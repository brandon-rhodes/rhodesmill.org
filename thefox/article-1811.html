<H3>Fox to Recommence Soon!</H3>
<B>[11 June 1999]</B>
Next week the Fox,
having completed his bachelor's degree,
will return to the trail in a bid to reach Katahdin by late August.
He will continue from where he left off
near the Delaware / New Jersey border.
During the fall he acquired hiking poles,
with which he hopes to prevent the debilitating knee inflamation
that scuttled his hike last year.
<P>
Reflection upon last summers' experiences on the trail
has lead the Fox to adopt a less rigorous approach toward through hiking.
He has declined to construct a strict schedule as he did for last summer,
and instead plans to vary his speed and activity
with both the circumstances and his own morale.
He will also opt not to take a stove this time
to encourage a simpler lifestyle and lighter pack.
</P>
