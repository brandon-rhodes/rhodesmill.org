<B>[25 July 1999]</B>
On Sunday night the Fox checked in,
and reported that he is safely past the Presidential range of New Hampshire
without sharing any of the dire experiences shared by southbounders.
The wind was blowing at around 20 to 25 miles per hour.
His path took him in and out of the clouds,
but offered many good views when he passed out of them.
He mentioned in particular that it was ``exceptionally clear''
when he reached Franconia Ridge
and offered a ``spectacular view.''
From Gorham he will quickly pass into Maine,
the final state of his journey.
<P>
[<B>Editorial Note:</B> you have probably noticed
these updates slowing somewhat,
as the maintainer of these pages prepares to leave for a two-week vacation
that will end with picking up the Fox at Katahdin.
An effort will be made despite this to continue updating the pages.
Be forewarned, however, that when the Fox enters the hundred-mile wilderness
at the end of the trail that updates will probably cease
until we meet him at the other end.]
