<B>[10 July 1998]</B>
Within the past week the Fox was given an unanticipated invitation
from a friend to stay in Lynchburg,
which he has accepted.
He reported that he was fed a very good meal.
The Fox reports that temperature highs have been around 70 and 80 degrees,
and that during difficult uphill climbs he is `incredibly' sweaty.
Those vistas which are available to him consist primarily
of ridgetop overlooks,
and he recently enjoyed one good sunset over a valley
(he usually tries to be in camp by sunset).
Recently the Fox hiked a <NOBR>27.4 mile</NOBR> day to make up for some
accumulated lost time;
at the end of this trek some other campers were generous enough
to offer him a steak.
The Fox hiked with NaPensee (Miller Templeton) most of today,
after the latter skipped part of the trail by car.
