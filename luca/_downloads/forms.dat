; Step 1: Compute W-2 line 1
;

; Lines 3 and 5 can simply be filled in with the raw value given as the
; employee "Wages", but line 1 should subtract out any deferrals toward
; retirement.

= "Forms:W-2:Wages"
    $account                                              -1
    Forms:W-2: 1 Wages                                     1
    Forms:W-2: 3 Social security wages                     1
    Forms:W-2: 5 Medicare wages                            1
    Forms:W-2                                             -2

= "Forms:W-2:Retirement deferral"
    $account                                              -1
    Forms:W-2: 1 Wages                                     1

; Step 2: Compute Social Security and Medicare taxes
;
; Social Security and Medicare tax rates vary from year to year.
; Through the end of 2012, Congress was offering employees a lower 4.2%
; Social Security tax rate compared to the 6.2% paid by employers.

= expr (account == "Forms:W-2:Wages" & date < [2013/01/01])
 Forms:W-2: 4 Social security                     (- 0.0420)
 Forms:W-2: 6 Medicare                            (- 0.0145)
 Forms:Due:Payroll                         (0.0420 + 0.0145)

= expr (account == "Forms:W-2:Wages" & date < [2013/01/01])
 Forms:941: 5a Social Security             (0.0620 + 0.0420)
 Forms:941: 5c Medicare                    (0.0145 + 0.0145)
 Forms:Due:941:Payroll withheld          (- 0.0420 - 0.0145)
 Forms:Due:941:Employer taxes            (- 0.0620 - 0.0145)

; But with the beginning of 2013, the employee rate went back to 6.2%.

= expr (account == "Forms:W-2:Wages" & date >= [2013/01/01])
 Forms:W-2: 4 Social security                     (- 0.0620)
 Forms:W-2: 6 Medicare                            (- 0.0145)
 Forms:Due:Payroll                         (0.0620 + 0.0145)

= expr (account == "Forms:W-2:Wages" & date >= [2013/01/01])
 Forms:941: 5a Social Security             (0.0620 + 0.0620)
 Forms:941: 5c Medicare                    (0.0145 + 0.0145)
 Forms:Due:941:Payroll withheld          (- 0.0620 - 0.0145)
 Forms:Due:941:Employer taxes            (- 0.0620 - 0.0145)

; Form W-2 line 2 obligates us to pay the same amount on 941.

= "Forms:W-2: 2 Federal income tax"
 Forms:Due:941:Payroll withheld                            1
 Forms:941: 3 Income tax withheld                         -1

;
; -----------------------------------------------------------------
; Step 2: Detect when we have paid all of these various obligations
;

; Form 941

= "Expenses: 7:Form 941"
 Forms:Due:941:Payroll withheld                            1
