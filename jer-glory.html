<h1>Glory</h1>

<p>I wish I could say something to
distinguish Flowery Branch from thousands of little towns of
a few hundred inhabitants all over our land in the early
forties. But I cannot. It is not even in the middle of an
S-turn in the Southern railway; the track is straight for
five or six miles to the north, and to the south there is
gentle curve to the southwest that does not slow a train.
</p><p>
The main street parallels the railroad, and along the street
the usual feed store, hardware store, drug store were
scattered. Most of the people lived within two blocks of the
railroad. </p><p>
A ratty local stopped there daily to take on and put off
express, but most travellers rode the bus. A local freight
fussed with cars in the siding from time to time, but most
freights roared through, as did the several limited
passenger trains. Nine miles from Gainsville, their nearest
stop, gave the southbounds time to come up to full cruising
speed before they had covered those five straight miles from
the north.</p>

<p>Bob&rsquo;s parents came to John
Echols&rsquo; law office in the summer of 1944. They wanted
to probate their son&rsquo;s will; he had been missing in
action for well over a year. Out of true prudence&mdash;or
else on a hunch&mdash;John urged them to wait a while
longer. That was his part in the story, and why he knew it.
</p><p>
Bob had his airplane hit by AA fire over occupied France; he
had been able to get out and parachute to where a rural
French family took him in almost as he touched the earth
that dark clear night. Some days later they introduced him
to members of the local underground. </p><p>
Some background of Bob&rsquo;s proved to be a big help in
sorting and editing information the underground was sending
to the Allies via several routes. Fortuitously, this got
recognized, and he was ordered to stay; no attempt was made
to spirit him out. </p><p>
After some months Intelligence thought they learned that
Bob&rsquo;s operation was in danger, or maybe his skills
were no longer imperative, so they spirited him out to
rejoin our armies. (We did not muff everything in those
days.) </p><p>
His superiors were highly pleased with what he had
accomplished. After debriefing in Washington, they were
ready to give him leave, announce he was still alive, and
let him go home to the welcome towns give their heroes. </p><p>
They would fly him home, give him priority to bump almost
anyone off our overloaded wartime airlines. He declined,
explaining that they could fly him only to the Atlanta
airport. Then he would have to get a taxi and a bus, and it
would be noon tomorrow before he got home to Flowery Branch.
Could they possibly stop the Southerner in the morning, and
let him off?</p>

<p>The chime of a steam whistle did
not excite the town shortly after nine that bright October
morning. That, or a diesel horn, regularly sounded as
everyone was getting to work and starting the day if
Number&nbsp;47 was on time. A minute later people started
acting uneasy and nervous, and this intensified during the
next minute. Something was strange. The familiar sequence of
sounds, that everyone had unconsciously come to expect, was
different. </p><p>
Somewhere north of the depot someone shouted, &ldquo;The
Southerner is stopping!&rdquo; and the cry was taken up in
the next block, &ldquo;The Southerner is stopping!&rdquo; It
had never happened before! People on the street stopped and
turned to watch; people came out of stores to see what was
going on. Everybody was looking. Everybody in town was
looking. The engineer crossed his cab to the left side,
climbed down, walked back to join the rest of the train
crew, at the vestibule a porter had opened. Conductor,
porters, attendents, engineer, all lined up at Bob&rsquo;s
vestibule. And then came Bob, long given up as lost, pressed
new uniform, bright clean ribbons and theater bars. Nobody
failed to see him as he stepped down, saluted the crew as
they piped him off with cheers and applause, and the fireman
blew a long blast on the whistle. Everybody saw him.</p>

<h2>Epilog</h2>

<p>John Echols was a storyteller.
It never improved one of his stories to ask for details he
had omitted. He instictively (or by hard work and guile)
tersely set up his scene, then delivered the sentence that
made it a story. </p><p>
Storytellers carefully select what they tell, and what they
leave out. Sometimes elements of several lesser stories get
rolled into one. Mr. John told me this story some thirty
years ago (forty as I today reword a sentence here and
there), and when I set out to write it down I found I had
the story with almost no background details. I did not know
Bob&rsquo;s name, neither given nor family. Any of several
towns between Gainesville and Atlanta would have served for
Flowery Branch. Steam or diesel, either could have pulled
the Southerner during World War II. The Time Table said for
the Southerner, &ldquo;Streamlined Diesel Electric,&rdquo;
but I rode it time and again behind one of those beautiful
green Pacifics. Railroads used whatever motive power they
could assemble in those busy days. </p><p>
It had to be steam that morning. A Diesel horn says bluntly,
&ldquo;Clear the tracks,&rdquo; but a steam passenger
whistle says, &ldquo;Please, please, clear the tracks, then
turn &rsquo;round and watch this wonderful vehicle with all
the machinery on the outside.&rdquo; Who will dispute that a
steam chime was needed that day? </p><p>
If this story did not happen about like I set it down, it
should have.</p>
