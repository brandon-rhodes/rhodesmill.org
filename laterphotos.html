At least twice during his lifetime, Joseph Elmer Rhodes Sr., the
father of the Elmer Rhodes whose <a href="history.html">essays</a>
we have made available on line, visited the site of the old mill.
The first visit in 1916 found the mill in ruins but it and many
other buildings still standing; but by the second visit in 1939,
forest had reclaimed all remains of the settlement men had carved
into it.
<h2>The Summer of 1916</h2>
Descendants of Newton Marion Rhodes visited Shell in the summer of
1916, fifteen years after his death, to tour the remains of the old
family business. The group included Newton's grandson Joseph Elmer
Rhodes Sr., who was around 26 years old at the time.<br>

<td><b>The Mill in Ruins.</b> Joseph Elmer Rhodes,&nbsp;Sr. shows
his family the ruins of the mill operated by his grandfather. He is
standing on the same dock that is visible in the photograph of the
mill in 1897 (see above). Note the smokestack, which was added when
the mill converted to steam power late in its career.</td>

in which some of the family lived during the mill's heyday. Hard to

(from the left) the garage for the surrey, a house for Bob the
chauffeur, and a garage for Dave's buggy.</td>

for both arriving logs and departing lumber, as well as providing

<h2>Family Visits the Site, Circa 1940</h2>
Around the year 1940 the next generation of the family returned to
Shell; Joseph Elmer Rhodes Sr. now had children with whom to share
the family's history. They toured the area where the Rhodes Mill
had operated, though the ruins had by now disappeared.<br>
