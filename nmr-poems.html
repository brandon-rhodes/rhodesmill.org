<h2>The Water
Mill</h2>

<p>The winds are Shrill the mills
are Still <br>
The frozen pond is fringed with Snow <br>
And broken ice in Strange devise <br>
Lies on the Sunlit banks below</p>

<p>When I am cold, my children old
<br>
Our place who&rsquo;ll fill or mill rebuild <br>
Will lands be Sold that we now hold <br>
And Strangers all our homesteads fill</p>

<p>The mill you love&mdash; then
push and Shove <br>
But from the mill the hungry fill <br>
Do what is right in dark or light <br>
And we&rsquo;ll perpetuate this mill</p>

<p>This is my will when I am dead
<br>
You join as one the mill improve <br>
Join heart and hand and hold this land <br>
And Strongly build the the mill with love</p>

<p>Love man and God while here you
build <br>
Let your foundation be his word <br>
Your children rais to do his will <br>
And leaks and breaks will not be feared</p>

<p>When I am gone will you go on
<br>
With love for each to Each be just <br>
Let love my vacant places fill <br>
And faithful prove every trust</p>

<p>I ve toiled long to make you
Strong <br>
Be guided by the God of love <br>
Let weak nor Strong lead you to wrong <br>
But proove on firm for heaven above</p>

<h2>Lena Children</h2>

<p>It is a crowning pleasure when
<br>
I hear sweet Bessie&rsquo;s coos and glee <br>
And slow soft tone of Ethel N <br>
And Elmers earnest call for me</h2>

<p>Grand children are the crown
<br>
They call up pleasures from <br>
the past. <br>
Though they may prate and pout <br>
and frown <br>
In sunshine all will end <br>
at last</p>

<h2>Luera Young</h2>

<p>I ll not forget your Sweet Sad
face <br>
Nor form so fair nor heart So true <br>
With trust I trace the home you grace <br>
With tender ties left lone with you</h2>

<p>When I feel lone I ll pictuer
you <br>
A blossom bowd in tears awhile <br>
Like drops of dew in rainbow hew <br>
To deck your home when Sunshine Smile</p>

<p>Shell, Ala Nov

<h2>Our Lifes</h2>

<p>Life been cold and dark and
drear <br>
We may have winter weather <br>
But Sunless days we ll pass dear one <br>
In perfect peace togather <br>
Lifes Snow that falls will pass away <br>
And leave our day more brighter <br>
So every trial truly braved <br>
Will leave lifes burden lighter</h2>


<p>Had I not
learned your turns and traits <br>
The light and Shade along your ways <br>
I might have past your open gates <br>
And grooped in darkness all my days</p>


<hr>
<h2>In the Heart</h2>

<p>A Stream of love for all doth
lie <br>
A stronger cord for Kindred bind <br>
But Still there is a nearer tie <br>
In Silence round our tendrils twine</h2>

<p>T is wove by one who cleavs
lifes tide <br>
At evry turn in rise and fall <br>
Who weep when want and woe betide <br>
But bravely Stem the Storm of all</p>

There will be rest&mdash;etoms</p>
