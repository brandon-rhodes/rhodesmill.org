<p>The <a class="reference external" href="http://compass-style.org/">Compass CSS authoring framework</a>
has become one of the standard tools
that gets installed when I start working on a new web application.
I&nbsp;always version-control
not only the <tt class="docutils literal">.scss</tt> Sass source files that I myself write,
but also the <tt class="docutils literal">.css</tt> CSS files that Compass compiles from them.
That way, anyone who checks out the project
immediately gets a working web site
without having to install Compass —
or even having to know that it exists,
if they are not themselves involved in writing the CSS.</p>
<p>But those of us who work on the CSS do need Compass,
so I have a standard technique that I copy from project to project
that installs Compass into a small, local Ruby environment,
providing the same kind of isolation and reproducibility
that Python has taught me to know and love
thanks to <a class="reference external" href="http://www.virtualenv.org/">virtualenv</a>.</p>
<p>The process goes like this.</p>
<p>First I create a <tt class="docutils literal">compass/</tt> directory,
typically up at the top level of the project,
that initially contains nothing but a pair of shell scripts.
The first script, <tt class="docutils literal">install.sh</tt>, knows how to get Compass
downloaded and installed:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="c">#!/bin/bash</span>
<span class="c"># compass/install.sh - install Compass under the &quot;./Gem&quot; directory</span>

<span class="k">if</span> ! which gem &gt;/dev/null ;<span class="k">then</span>
<span class="k">    </span><span class="nb">echo</span> <span class="s1">&#39;Error: no &quot;gem&quot; command available&#39;</span>
    <span class="nb">echo</span> <span class="s1">&#39;Please &quot;sudo aptitude install rubygems1.8&quot; or &quot;ruby1.9.1&quot;&#39;</span>
    <span class="nb">exit </span>1
<span class="k">fi</span>
<span class="nv">BASE</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="k">$(</span>dirname <span class="k">$(</span>readlink -f <span class="k">$(</span>which <span class="s2">&quot;$0&quot;</span><span class="k">)))</span>
<span class="nb">cd</span> <span class="nv">$BASE</span>  <span class="c"># the directory where this script lives</span>
gem install -i Gem compass
gem install -i Gem compass-susy-plugin</pre></div>

<p>When this shell script is run, a <tt class="docutils literal">compass/Gem/</tt> directory
gets created with the <tt class="docutils literal">compass</tt> command down inside of it.
To let me forget where the binary is located
and how it can be safely invoked,
a second shell script named <tt class="docutils literal">compass.sh</tt> wraps up the details:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="c">#!/bin/bash</span>
<span class="c"># compass/compass.sh - properly invoke the &quot;Compass&quot; program</span>

<span class="nv">BASE</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="k">$(</span>dirname <span class="k">$(</span>readlink -f <span class="k">$(</span>which <span class="s2">&quot;$0&quot;</span><span class="k">)))</span>
<span class="nb">export </span><span class="nv">GEM_HOME</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="nv">$BASE</span>/Gem
<span class="nb">export </span><span class="nv">RUBYLIB</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="nv">$BASE</span>/Gem/lib
<span class="nv">$BASE</span>/Gem/bin/compass <span class="s2">&quot;$@&quot;</span></pre></div>

<p>I always tell my version-control system
to ignore the <tt class="docutils literal">compass/Gem/</tt> directory
and the 5,115 files that Ruby creates beneath it;
instead, I simply remember to re-run <tt class="docutils literal">install.sh</tt>
after each fresh checkout
when I want to get to work on the CSS.</p>
<p>When I first start a project,
I need an initial set of <tt class="docutils literal">.scss</tt> files to start editing,
which can be supplied through the Compass command <tt class="docutils literal">create</tt>.
Usually I want the CSS output to be written
somewhere outside of the <tt class="docutils literal">compass/</tt> directory,
so my initialization steps go something like this:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="err">$</span> <span class="n">cd</span> <span class="n">compass</span><span class="o">/</span>
<span class="err">$</span> <span class="p">.</span><span class="o">/</span><span class="n">install</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">sh</span>
<span class="err">$</span> <span class="p">.</span><span class="o">/</span><span class="n">compass</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">sh</span> <span class="n">create</span>
<span class="err">$</span> <span class="n">rm</span> <span class="o">-</span><span class="n">r</span> <span class="n">stylesheets</span><span class="o">/</span>    <span class="err">#</span> <span class="n">where</span> <span class="n">Compass</span> <span class="n">wanted</span> <span class="n">the</span> <span class="n">output</span> <span class="n">CSS</span><span class="o">!</span>
<span class="err">$</span> <span class="n">emacs</span> <span class="n">config</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">rb</span>
<span class="cp"># There, I adjust the line: css_dir = &quot;../webapp/static/css&quot;</span>
<span class="cp"># Plus, I also tend to set: line_comments = false</span>
<span class="cp"># Of course, use your editor-of-choice for this step!</span></pre></div>

<p>I check into version control the <tt class="docutils literal">config.rb</tt> file
and the <tt class="docutils literal">compass/src/</tt> directory of pristine <tt class="docutils literal">.scss</tt> files.
I tell my version-control system to ignore
the <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">.sass-cache/</span></tt> directory that gets created inside of <tt class="docutils literal">compass/</tt>
each time the CSS is rebuilt.</p>
<p>Once those changes checked in,
I never need to run the <tt class="docutils literal">create</tt> command again
for the whole lifetime of the project.
Instead, whenever I am ready to work on the CSS,
I simply open the <tt class="docutils literal">.scss</tt> files in my editor
and in another window I do this:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="err">$</span> <span class="n">cd</span> <span class="n">compass</span><span class="o">/</span>
<span class="err">$</span> <span class="p">.</span><span class="o">/</span><span class="n">compass</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">sh</span> <span class="n">watch</span></pre></div>

<p>Just as a good development web server
will auto-restart when you finish editing a file and hit <em>Save</em>,
the Compass <tt class="docutils literal">watch</tt> command will sit patiently all day
and re-compile your Sass files to CSS whenever it sees you change them.
By leaving it running, I can edit a <tt class="docutils literal">.scss</tt> file
and then hit <em>Reload</em> in my browser almost immediately to see the result
without having to stop and run any intermediate commands.</p>
<p>The files, therefore, that wind up in my version control are these:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="n">compass</span><span class="o">/</span><span class="n">compass</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">sh</span>
<span class="n">compass</span><span class="o">/</span><span class="n">config</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">rb</span>
<span class="n">compass</span><span class="o">/</span><span class="n">install</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">sh</span>
<span class="n">compass</span><span class="o">/</span><span class="n">src</span><span class="o">/</span><span class="n">_base</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">scss</span>
<span class="n">compass</span><span class="o">/</span><span class="n">src</span><span class="o">/</span><span class="n">_defaults</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">scss</span>
<span class="n">compass</span><span class="o">/</span><span class="n">src</span><span class="o">/</span><span class="n">ie</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">scss</span>
<span class="n">compass</span><span class="o">/</span><span class="n">src</span><span class="o">/</span><span class="n">print</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">scss</span>
<span class="n">compass</span><span class="o">/</span><span class="n">src</span><span class="o">/</span><span class="n">screen</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">scss</span></pre></div>

<p>And, of course, I also version-control
the CSS files that Compass writes as output,
over where I put them in the “main directory” of my web application:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="n">webapp</span><span class="o">/</span><span class="k">static</span><span class="o">/</span><span class="n">css</span><span class="o">/</span><span class="n">ie</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">css</span>
<span class="n">webapp</span><span class="o">/</span><span class="k">static</span><span class="o">/</span><span class="n">css</span><span class="o">/</span><span class="n">print</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">css</span>
<span class="n">webapp</span><span class="o">/</span><span class="k">static</span><span class="o">/</span><span class="n">css</span><span class="o">/</span><span class="n">screen</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">css</span></pre></div>

<p>This all works out extremely well.
Normal developers and deployers look under the <tt class="docutils literal">webapp/</tt> directory
and see what looks like normal,
if preternaturally well-written and organized,
CSS files exactly where they expect to find them.
Only we CSS geeks on the project
know that they are written by shuffling over to the Compass directory
and firing up a program that compiles them from simpler source files.
And thanks to my handy little pair of shell scripts,
the Compass install itself is always completely automated.</p>
<p>Of course, as you can tell from the error message
that <tt class="docutils literal">install.sh</tt> prints if it cannot find Ruby,
these scripts are aimed at an audience using Ubuntu or Debian.
