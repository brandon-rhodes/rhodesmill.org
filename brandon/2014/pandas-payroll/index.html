</table><p>I will admit it:
I only thought to pull out <a href="http://pandas.pydata.org/">Pandas</a>
when my Python script was nearly complete,
because running <code>print</code> on a Pandas data frame
would save me the trouble of formatting 12 rows of data by hand.</p>
<p>But as I added the <code>import</code> statement,
it suddenly struck me
that Pandas aggregate operations
might be able to replace some of the steps inside my big <code>for</code> loop.
Half an hour later,
my loop had disappeared completely
and my entire script was reduced
to a short sequence of Pandas method calls!</p>
<p>This post is a brief tour of the final script,
written up as <a href="http://rhodesmill.org/brandon/2014/pandas-payroll.ipynb">an IPython notebook</a>
and organized around five basic lessons
that I learned about Pandas by applying it to this problem.</p>
<h2 id="1.-Pandas-lets-you-bring-your-own-objects">1. Pandas lets you bring your own objects<a class="anchor-link" href="#1.-Pandas-lets-you-bring-your-own-objects">&#182;</a></h2><p>The most surprising feature
of tools like the NumPy vector library and the Pandas data series
might be that they let you bring your own objects to the party.</p>
<p>Since they were invented to efficiently pack
millions of floating-point values into a single Python object,
you might think that these libraries would only work
with numeric types that they themselves can express as vectors.
But in fact they have a clean fallback behavior
when faced with alternative numeric types:
they essentially turn into Python lists,
and keep a separate reference to each object that you have supplied.
When asked to perform their famous aggregate operations —
this is the crucial step —
they simply turn to the objects
and call the <code>__add__()</code> or <code>__mul__()</code> method of every single item
to build the result.</p>
<p>When doing taxes and pay stubs
we always want to use Python <code>Decimal</code> objects
to guarantee correctness and careful rounding to cents,
which we can implement with a simple <code>c()</code> function:</p>

<div class=" highlight hl-python3"><pre><span class="kn">from</span> <span class="nn">decimal</span> <span class="k">import</span> <span class="n">Decimal</span>

<span class="n">one_cent</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">Decimal</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s">&#39;0.01&#39;</span><span class="p">)</span>

<span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">c</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">value</span><span class="p">):</span>
    <span class="s">&quot;Convert `value` to Decimal cents.&quot;</span>
    <span class="k">return</span> <span class="n">Decimal</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">value</span><span class="p">)</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">quantize</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">one_cent</span><span class="p">)</span></pre></div>

<p>You might think that my next step
will be building a twelve-element list
with which to initialize the monthly wages
in our payroll table.
But data frames let us do something simpler:
we can supply a single value for a column,
and Pandas will automatically broadcast it
across the whole index that we have defined.
Here we set up the twelve calendar months of the year
and imagine the simple case
of someone who makes the same wage every month:</p>

<div class=" highlight hl-python3"><pre><span class="kn">import</span> <span class="nn">pandas</span> <span class="k">as</span> <span class="nn">pd</span>
<span class="kn">from</span> <span class="nn">calendar</span> <span class="k">import</span> <span class="n">month_abbr</span>

<p>An example wage of $11,000 per month might sound grandiose,
but I have chosen it so that this example
will reach the Social Security wage limit by the end of the year —
to test whether we model the limit correctly in our data frame.</p>
<h2 id="2.-Mapping-is-suddenly-worth-it">2. Mapping is suddenly worth it<a class="anchor-link" href="#2.-Mapping-is-suddenly-worth-it">&#182;</a></h2><p>The second surprise of working with Pandas
is the convenience of its <code>map()</code> method,
<!--more-->
which lets us build a new series
by passing each element of an existing series
through a transform function.
Here, for example,
we compute the federal withholding that will be due
each month for our employee
by using the <code>TaxSchedule</code> object of my
<a href="https://github.com/brandon-rhodes/luca">Luca accounting library</a>:</p>

<p>It surprised me that mapping was so pleasant,
because the current Python habit is to avoid <code>map()</code> —
which, after all, <a href="http://www.artima.com/weblogs/viewpost.jsp?thread=98196">Guido nearly removed from Python 3’s built-ins</a> —
in favor of list comprehensions.
Not only are comprehensions far more general
because they can pivot from calling a function
to computing any other kind of expression for each input item,
but they actually look like they are calling a function
because its name gets followed by parentheses
just as in any other function call:</p>

<div class=" highlight hl-python3"><pre><span class="c"># List comprehension versus calling map()</span>

<span class="n">line1</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="p">[</span><span class="n">federal_monthly</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">compute_tax_on</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">w</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="k">for</span> <span class="n">w</span> <span class="ow">in</span> <span class="n">df</span><span class="p">[</span><span class="s">&#39;wage&#39;</span><span class="p">]]</span>
<span class="n">line2</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">df</span><span class="p">[</span><span class="s">&#39;wage&#39;</span><span class="p">]</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">map</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">federal_monthly</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">compute_tax_on</span><span class="p">)</span></pre></div>

<p>But in the particular case of Pandas
a comprehension has disadvantages.</p>
<p>First, it adds syntactic noise.
Line 1 is not simply longer than line 2,
but visually busier as well.
Iteration that ought to be quietly implied inside of a vector
becomes an external and noisy <code>for</code> loop instead.
The eye has to travel to check that the <code>w</code> loop item
is indeed the input to the function.
And an extra pair of square brackets surrounds the whole affair.</p>
<p>The second disadvantage is small for this particular data set,
but still conceptually regrettable:
the list comprehension spins up an extra throw-away <code>list</code>
as a temporary holding pen
for the values that are really destined to live
inside the Pandas data frame.</p>
<p>Finally, you will soon see
that chaining Pandas method calls one after another
is a pretty common way to take an input series,
perform a useful sequence of operations upon it,
and be left with a useful result.
Method calls to <code>map()</code> dovetail perfectly inside of this pattern,
while list comprehensions make you break out of it.</p>
<p>So my Pandas code
not only features my only calls to a <code>map()</code> routine these days,
but tends to do it pretty often —
and is simpler and cleaner as a result!</p>
<h2 id="3.-Pandas-operations-can-go-down,-not-just-across">3. Pandas operations can go down, not just across<a class="anchor-link" href="#3.-Pandas-operations-can-go-down,-not-just-across">&#182;</a></h2><p>My first exposure to Pandas, and to NumPy for that matter,
involved two kinds of operations.
First, there were binary operators like <code>a + b</code>
that we normally think of as involving two numbers,
but that when applied to whole vectors
might do thousands or millions of pairwise operations instead.
Second, there were aggregate operators,
that take an entire vector and produce its minimum, maximum, sum,
or even full statistics about the contents.</p>
<p>But the key to computing payroll taxes
is to perform a third kind of operation:
a cumulative sum of the wages paid to date
so that the result can be compared with the Social Security wage limit,
the point at which one’s Social Security obligation for the year
is complete:</p>

<div class=" highlight hl-python3"><pre><span class="c"># For 2014</span>
<span class="n">ss_limit</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">c</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s">&#39;117000.00&#39;</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="n">ss_rate</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">Decimal</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s">&#39;0.062&#39;</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="n">mc_rate</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">Decimal</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s">&#39;0.0145&#39;</span><span class="p">)</span></pre></div>

<p>It turns out that Pandas has a cumulative operator
that fits this situation perfectly!
The <code>cumsum()</code> method takes a series as its input
and produces a series of cumulative totals instead:</p>

<div class=" highlight hl-python3"><pre><span class="nb">print</span> <span class="n">df</span><span class="p">[</span><span class="s">&#39;wage&#39;</span><span class="p">]</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">cumsum</span><span class="p">()</span></pre></div>

<pre class="output">

</pre>
<p>After computing this cumulative sum,
we can apply the Social Security limit
using the convenient <code>clip_upper()</code> method —
which took me several minutes to find,
because I somehow thought that <em>minimum</em>
would have wound up somewhere in its name —
to assure that we incur no additional tax obligation
once the limit has been reached.</p>
<p>Thanks to how cleanly Pandas methods chain together,
this can simply be added as another step
beyond the <code>cumsum()</code> call:</p>

<div class=" highlight hl-python3"><pre><span class="n">cum_ss_wage</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">df</span><span class="p">[</span><span class="s">&#39;wage&#39;</span><span class="p">]</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">cumsum</span><span class="p">()</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">clip_upper</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">ss_limit</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="nb">print</span> <span class="n">cum_ss_wage</span></pre></div>

<pre class="output">

Oct    110000.00
Nov    117000.00
Dec    117000.00

</pre>
<p>Finally, we need to step backwards.
Having created a cumulative sum involving the wages earned to date,
we need to split out each month’s earnings
back into a separate stand-alone value.</p>
<p>Pandas supports this with a <code>diff()</code> method
that is the opposite of <code>cumsum()</code>
except that the first row of the result will be <code>NaN</code>
(the numerics code for “not a number”)
because pairwise subtraction between twelve rows of data
produces only eleven values.
No problem!
Not-a-number comes up so often in data operations
that Pandas provides a <code>fillna()</code> method
that lets us restore that first value
from our original series of monthly wages.</p>

<div class=" highlight hl-python3"><pre><span class="n">ss_wage</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">cum_ss_wage</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">diff</span><span class="p">()</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">fillna</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">df</span><span class="p">[</span><span class="s">&#39;wage&#39;</span><span class="p">])</span>

<p>We now know exactly how many dollars
are susceptible to Social Security tax each month,
and are ready to finish out our data frame.</p>
<h2 id="4.-Throwaway-series-need-not-live-in-your-data-frame">4. Throwaway series need not live in your data frame<a class="anchor-link" href="#4.-Throwaway-series-need-not-live-in-your-data-frame">&#182;</a></h2><p>In an early version of this computation,
I was faithfully attaching each of the intermediate series
that we computed above as new columns to my growing data frame.
Between the <code>fedwh</code> column and the <code>ss_tax</code> column in the table below,
imagine seeing all of my intermediate results —
extra columns with names like <code>cumwage</code>, <code>cumw_clipped</code>,
<code>clipped_diff</code>, and <code>ss_wage</code>.
To make a reasonable display of the table,
I had to cut more than half of its columns out!</p>
<p>It was therefore something of an epiphany
to realize that intermediate data series
need not be stored in the data frame at all.
Look at <code>ss_wage</code> from the previous section as a perfect example:
even though I have kept it outside my data frame as a stand-alone series,
it follows all the same rules as data frame columns,
participates in aggregate operations,
and even gets to use the data frame’s own index.</p>
<p>Stand-alone series keep my data frame clean.
I save as columns only the outputs that need to be displayed,
like the Social Security and Medicare taxes
that get printed on a monthly pay stub:</p>

<p>Note again that all of this math
has been performed by real first-class <code>Decimal</code> objects
doing the same rounding that is implemented by the Internal Revenue Service.
This is a grid of true decimal objects —
organized and displayed by Pandas,
but to which Pandas is always deferring the actual math.</p>
<h2 id="5.-Reporting-becomes-easy">5. Reporting becomes easy<a class="anchor-link" href="#5.-Reporting-becomes-easy">&#182;</a></h2><p>Finally, my Pandas data frame
not only did a great job of formatting itself for terminal output —
exempting me from the fussy job
of measuring column widths, justifying fields, and adding whitespace —
but it could effortlessly slice and aggrate the table as well.
Here, for instance, is an individual pay stub for September:</p>

<div class=" highlight hl-python3"><pre><span class="nb">print</span> <span class="s">&#39;September payroll stub:&#39;</span>
<span class="nb">print</span> <span class="n">df</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">ix</span><span class="p">[</span><span class="s">&#39;Sep&#39;</span><span class="p">]</span></pre></div>

<pre class="output">
September payroll stub:
wage        11000.00
fedwh        2596.05
ss_tax        682.00
mc_tax        159.50
statewh        95.00
paycheck     7467.45
Name: Sep, dtype: object
</pre>
<p>And generating a W-2 for delivery to the employee
at year’s end is as simple as applying Python’s <code>sum</code> routine to each column
— the data frame does have a <code>sum()</code> method,
but it seems to insist on operating in floating point —
and letting Pandas display the result:</p>

<div class=" highlight hl-python3"><pre><span class="nb">print</span> <span class="s">&#39;End-of-year W-2&#39;</span>
<span class="nb">print</span> <span class="n">df</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">apply</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nb">sum</span><span class="p">)</span></pre></div>

<pre class="output">
End-of-year W-2
wage        132000.00
fedwh        31152.60

mc_tax        1914.00
statewh       1140.00

dtype: object
</pre>
<p>When I first saw Pandas touted,
I planned to use it the next time I had a big problem —
like a million-line Apache log file.
But it turns out to do just as well with tiny problems.
Unlike heavyweight solutions
that are not worth trotting out and setting up
unless one has a truly big problem to deploy them against,
Pandas scaled right down to my twelve-line paystub table
and made my code simpler and easier to maintain.</p>
<p>Even on a tiny data set it is more than worth it to import <code>pandas</code>,
set up your index, and get to work!</p>
