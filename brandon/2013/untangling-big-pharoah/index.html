</table><p>An interesting diagram has been making the rounds on the Internet.
Attributed to a Twitter personality
named <a href="https://twitter.com/TheBigPharaoh">@TheBigPharaoh</a> —
whose tweets draw attention to the humanitarian
and human rights situation in Egypt —
it has been cited by no less an authority than the
<a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/worldviews/wp/2013/08/26/the-middle-east-explained-in-one-sort-of-terrifying-chart/">Washington Post, who calls it a “sort of terrifying”</a>
depiction of the modern Middle East.
But as a consumer of data,
I was immediately skeptical:
there are many ways to make quite simple information
look like chaos if it is presented poorly.</p>
<div class="figure"><a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/worldviews/files/2013/08/BSm0bOBCYAAAph6.jpg"><img style="width: 420px" src="http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/worldviews/files/2013/08/BSm0bOBCYAAAph6.jpg"></a></div><p>Is the information in the diagram really that complex?</p>
<p>I decided to try building a very simple data model
to see if it could predict every single relationship on the diagram.
Not because I think that the real Middle East (or anywhere else)
can be adequately described with a simple model,
but because I strongly suspected that the diagram itself
was in fact modeled on only a few basic regional divisions.</p>
<p class="note">
Update: reader Alex Burr points out five missing edges in
[`pharoahs-chart.json`](http://rhodesmill.org/brandon/2013/pharoahs-chart.json)
so please use
[`pharoahs-chart-v2.json`](http://rhodesmill.org/brandon/2013/pharoahs-chart-v2.json)
instead, which inspired an improvement in the article below:
Iran has been added to the `islamists` set,
which now overrules the Shia-Sunni split
to match the diagram’s assertion that they support Hamas.
</p><h2 id="Diving-into-the-data">Diving into the data<a class="anchor-link" href="#Diving-into-the-data">&#182;</a></h2><p>So I opened an IPython Notebook and got to work!
This blog post is, in fact, the notebook itself,
with some Markdown calls full of paragraphs and text
added to provide structure and commentary.
You can download the original notebook here:</p>
<p><a href="http://rhodesmill.org/brandon/2013/untangling-big-pharoah.ipynb"><code>untangling-big-pharoah.ipynb</code></a></p>
<p>So that every IPython Notebook does not begin
with the same series of verbose import statements,
IPython provides a <code>pylab</code> directive which imports a few dozen
essential NumPy features.
It is the first step that I took in getting ready to code:<!--more--></p>

<div class=" highlight hl-python3"><pre><span class="o">%</span><span class="n">pylab</span> <span class="n">inline</span></pre></div>

<pre class="output">
Populating the interactive namespace from numpy and matplotlib
</pre>
<p>So that other people can play with the diagram —
and probably do an even better job of analysis than I will here! —
I have chosen to represent it as JSON
instead of using a Python-specific format.
You can download my small data file here:</p>
<p><a href="http://rhodesmill.org/brandon/2013/pharoahs-chart-v2.json"><code>pharoahs-chart-v2.json</code></a></p>
<p>Once this file is saved to the current directory,
Python can load it quite easily with the <code>load()</code> method:</p>

<div class=" highlight hl-python3"><pre><span class="kn">import</span> <span class="nn">json</span>
<span class="k">with</span> <span class="nb">open</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s">&#39;pharoahs-chart-v2.json&#39;</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="k">as</span> <span class="n">f</span><span class="p">:</span>
    <span class="n">edges</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="nb">sorted</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">json</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">load</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">f</span><span class="p">))</span>

<span class="n">a</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">verb</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">b</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">array</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">edges</span><span class="p">)</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">T</span>
<span class="nb">print</span> <span class="s">&#39;Loaded&#39;</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="nb">len</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">verb</span><span class="p">),</span> <span class="s">&#39;edges&#39;</span></pre></div>

<pre class="output">
Loaded 42 edges
</pre>
<p>As is common when doing information processing in modern Python,
note that I have not left the data as a list-of-lists
as it is represented in the underlying JSON file.
Instead, I have passed the entire data structure
to the NumPy <code>array()</code> method
which I have then transposed
so that the input’s list of 3-element items
becomes three big vectors:
a vector of actors, a vector of verbs,
and finally another vector of actors at which those verbs
are respectively directed.</p>
<p>A quick count of the number of unique nodes
can be a quick way to check against misspellings,
since a misspelling will create two unique nodes
where the original diagram had only one.
Happily, computing the number of unique strings
shared between <code>a</code> and <code>b</code> yields
exactly the number of unique nodes in the actual diagram:</p>

<div class=" highlight hl-python3"><pre><span class="nb">print</span> <span class="s">&#39;Loaded&#39;</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="nb">len</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">unique</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">append</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">a</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">b</span><span class="p">))),</span> <span class="s">&#39;nodes&#39;</span></pre></div>

<pre class="output">
Loaded 15 nodes
</pre>
<p>We are nearly ready to explore the data!</p>
<p>I will propose a series of simple political models of the Middle East,
each of which is a function that,
given a political actor <code>a</code> like <code>"Turkey"</code>
and a potential client <code>b</code> like <code>"Syria Rebels"</code>,
returns one of three predictions:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>"supports"</code> — diagram’s blue lines</li>
<li><code>"hates"</code> — diagram’s red lines</li>
<li><code>"clueless"</code> — diagram’s green lines </li>
</ul>
<p>These predictions can then be compared
to the actual arrows on the diagram
to rate the political model for its accuracy.
Note carefully that these models
are only being judged for their ability to correctly color-code
the arrows that actually exist in the diagram;
they can return whatever nonsense they want
for arrows not in the diagram, like <code>("USA", "Turkey")</code>,
because we are only testing the functions against the input data set.</p>
<p>Because NumPy supports vector operations
that operate simultaneously on whole vectors of input values,
it only takes a single <code>==</code> operation to compare a series of
predictions against the series of actual supports/hates verbs
from the diagram.
The only catch is that, to perform the actual prediction,
we need to “vectorize” each little prediction function
to produce a routine that works on a whole vector at a time.
And we use another trick:
since a series of <code>==</code> decisions like <code>True</code> and <code>False</code>
are in fact equivalent to a series of numbers <code>1</code> or <code>0</code>,
we can use <code>sum()</code> to count how many <code>True</code> values are present!
Aside from these two nuances,
the reporting routine is rather simple Python:</p>

<p>Before getting all political,
we should test this analysis and reporting tool
by feeding it one or two dummy predictors
that are not actually interesting,
to see its output.
We will try exercising a pair of functions
that represent the perfect optimist and the perfect pessimist:
the one assumes that members of the human species always support one another,
while the other assumes that <code>"hates"</code> is the universal relationship.</p>

<div class=" highlight hl-python3"><pre><span class="n">try_predictor</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="k">lambda</span> <span class="n">a</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">b</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="s">&#39;supports&#39;</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">report</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="k">False</span><span class="p">)</span>

<pre class="output">

<p>It is a happy fact that the pessimist and optimist
are so perfectly balanced in this particular case:
the number of friendly links in the diagram, in other words,
is equal to the number of enemy relationships.
Which almost gives one hope for the world — not quite, but almost.</p>
<h2 id="Friends-and-Enemies">Friends and Enemies<a class="anchor-link" href="#Friends-and-Enemies">&#182;</a></h2><p>Given this infrastructure,
it will take only a few steps
to predict every single political relationship
in the Big Pharaoh’s diagram.
The real Middle East may be more complex than this,
but you would not know it from the diagram!</p>
<p>The first thing that strikes me
is how many red arrows cut left-to-right across the diagram
between the upper right, where we see Russia, Assad, and Iran,
and most of the rest of the state
and non-state actors that are depicted.
This has deep roots:
Islam became separated within its first few centuries
into a Sunni majority and a Shia minority (as well as many smaller groups),
the latter of which claims both Assad and the Iranian leadership as adherents.
If we place all of the Shia in a group and throw in Russia —
which shares a border with Iran and has served as an ally
following the overthrow of the United-States-backed Shah in 1979 —
then we find that we are almost halfway
to explaining the entire diagram:</p>

<p>You may be a bit confused about why I am performing a pair of <code>in</code>
operations and then comparing the output with an <code>!=</code> inequality operator.
The reason is that I am looking for situations where the answers
are either <code>True</code> and <code>False</code> or else the values <code>False</code> and <code>True</code>,
either one of which indicates that <code>a</code> and <code>b</code> fall on opposite sides
of the division.</p>
<p>This predictor brings our success rate to 70%.</p>
<p>But there is obviously more going on here,
because nearly 30% of the links in the diagram
are still being reported incorrectly.
Take a moment to read over the list of mis-predictions above.
Do they share anything in common?</p>
<p>What our first predictor seems blind to
is the opposition between populist Islamist movements 
and most of the nation-states involved in the region.
The Arab Spring has made it possible
that several of these organizations
will now make significant political gains
if they can turn their popular support into votes
in newly created democracies,
but they are considered terrorist organizations
by many Western nations and their allies.</p>
<p>Three state actors, though, have allied themselves
with the Islamist movements instead of opposing them.
Theocratic Iran was itself born of an Islamist revolution in 1979.
Turkey is a secular democracy that has been flirting with the idea
of a more explicitly Islamist government.
And Qatar is a more interesting case:
while the government itself is an autocracy,
it is a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wahhabi_movement">Wahabi</a> state
and thus is strongly aligned with the earnestly conservative Islam
that motivates many of these political and religious groups.</p>
<p>Adding these two rough allegiances into our model,
and assuming that Islamists always aid one another
while Islamists and moderates are always at odds,
very nearly completes the entire diagram!</p>

<p>Note my careful use of Python set operations to contrive
a succinct expression for “if one of the players is populist
and the other is autocratic” —
if it were not for the ability to do a quick test
for an intersection between one of the inputs
and either the <code>islamists</code> set or the <code>moderates</code> set,
this new <code>if</code> statement would have had to run to several lines.</p>
<p>The only thing now missing
is that our political predictor
never outputs the result <code>"clueless"</code>
and thus cannot correctly predict the stance of the United States
with respect to the power struggle in Egypt.
I will leave to more informed political commentators
whether this characterization of the current administration
is fair or not;
for our purposes, the only point is that it requires
the addition of but a third clause to our predictor,
yielding an absolutely perfect <code>p3()</code>:</p>

<h2 id="Lessons">Lessons<a class="anchor-link" href="#Lessons">&#182;</a></h2><p>For all of its chaotic hand-drawn relationships,
the Big Pharoah diagram really models only two regional feuds,
combined with a swipe at the United States
for its caution in engaging with either of two warring factions
within today’s Egypt.</p>
<p>I draw three lessons about information visualization from the fact
that a diagram whose politics are so simplistic
has been re-blogged as evidence that the Middle East is complicated.</p>
<p>First, the diagram presents a puzzle
for which the human vision is simply not optimized.
Never, to my knowledge, does Nature present a hunter-gatherer
with a web of different-colored links
and demand a quick intuition
about whether the nodes form only a few basic groupings
or are hopelessly splintered into several.
So presenting the information this way
makes it basically opaque.</p>
<p>Second, our eyes are very sensitive
to similarities between shapes,
yet the diagram takes a uniform relationship like “supports”
and splays it across the page at a half-dozen different
angles and sizes to create a perception of chaos.
The fact that the arrows are hand-drawn
adds an extra level of visual noise
that is simply icing on the cake.</p>
<p>Finally, edge-coloring turns out to be a fairly expensive way
to illustrate nodes that fall into a few groups,
because in the general case you wind up drawing n² edges
when instead you could just use 3 or 4 colors
to label broad groups
and then explain the relationships among them.
You could even use a mix of node-colorings and edges:
imagine a map of the 30 Years’ War
that colors Catholic countries one color,
Protestant countries another,
and then has a few annotations thrown in
to explain the exceptions to those natural allegances
that arose during the protracted conflict.
I suspect that the same approach would work better here.</p>
