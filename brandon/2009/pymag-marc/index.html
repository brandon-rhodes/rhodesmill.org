<p>
My first issue of Python Magazine is out!
</p>
<p>
After two months of being tutored in the arts of magazine publishing
by retiring editor Doug Hellmann,
March has been my first month in the Editor-in-Chief chair
of <a href="http://pythonmagazine.com/"><i>Python Magazine</i></a>.
It is exciting to have my first issue come out
while I am here at PyCon 2009
in Chicago.
I am talking with other programmers,
meeting new friends,
and, of course, eyeing everyone I meet
with the question of whether they might be suitable
author or technical editor material.
</p>
<p>
I am especially excited about our cover issue this month!
<b>“Commanding Robots with LEGO Mindstorms”</b> shows how simple it is
for a Python program to manipulate
both a binary on-the-wire protocol
<i>and</i> binary calls into a Windows DLL,
all without ever having to leave the Python standard library!
For me, this is the real magic of Python:
that it not only introduced an incomparably clean syntax
and tidy language feature set,
but that developers of both the standard library
and of third-party Python modules
are committed to creating vastly simple interfaces
for what in other languages can be very difficult problems.
The article is a great guide
to using best practices and powerful tools
when linking Python to other protocols and libraries.
</p>
<p>
Other articles include
<b>“Getting Started with Message Queues”</b>
which talks about how to arrange your application
around a central queue so that you can distribute expensive work
across dozens of machines;
<b>“Statically Analyzing Python Code”</b>
by the author of <a href="http://code.google.com/p/pysmell/">PySmell</a>
about how Python's built-in code parsing tools
can be used to start investigating powerful ideas
like type inferencing;
and <b>“Using Python for Pedigree Analysis”</b>
that is yet another success story from the world of science,
about how Python —
which began to be adopted very early in its history
by working scientists —
continues to move into new areas
wherever science needs a clean and powerful language
to replace the tangle of low-level code and temporary scripts
that traditionally characterize systems
written by those whose first expertise is not software design.
</p>
<p>
Throw in our several regular columns
and my own monthly editorial,
and you have a complete issue.
(I think it was while writing the editorial
that it really sank in that I am now an Editor-in-Chief!)
I hope you will consider subscribing,
and I especially hope you will subscribe to the print edition —
for only an extra dollar a month,
you will receive an actual, physical artifact
that you can leave in the breakroom at work,
share with a friend who wants to explore Python,
or leave at a client's site to expose their own employees
to the world of Python and its community.
And, say hello to me here at PyCon!
