<p>
  I am home from a relaxing vacation to the Midwest,
  and while I was gone last week my excellent publishing team
  released the July issue <i>Python Magazine</i> to the world.
  I am particularly pleased that two of the feature articles in this issue
  come from important segments of the Python world
  that we have not heard much from in previous issues.
</p>
<p>
  First,
  <a href="http://www.codeplex.com/IronPython"
     >IronPython, the .NET version of Python for Windows</a>,
  is the topic of Jonathan Hartley's article about acceptance testing.
  He illustrates that,
  regardless of the language
  in which you write your .NET application,
  you can deploy simple strategies
  to make your application testable
  through a Python test harness,
  and thereby bring Python's strong flexibility as a testing language
  to bear on a product
  that you might be writing in another .NET language.
</p>
<p>
  Second, Malthe Borch, a veteran of the Zope community,
  shares how he has written
  <a href="http://chameleon.repoze.org/">Chameleon,
  one of the fastest template language
  implementations available for Python</a>.
  By processing each template
  and turning it into Python bytecode
  before it is ever used to render a single page,
  Malthe eliminates a huge amount of redundant processing
  as that same code is used over and over again.
  His library is a key ingredient
  in the new high-efficiency web frameworks
  appearing in the Zope world.
  His work might even (fingers crossed) become one of the components
  that the Plone community uses
  as they streamline their framework
  and move towards a lighter and more agile “Plone 4”.
</p>
<p>
  Other technical topics covered are: the
  <a href="http://hadoop.apache.org/">Hadoop</a> map-reduce framework;
  the concept of hash functions, and how they apply to Python;
  and the new
  <a href="http://docs.python.org/library/string.html#format-string-syntax"
     >string formatting operator</a>
  which Guido hopes will replace all of the percent-signs
  that currently litter our code.
  Wrap it all up with an editorial by Steve Holden
  about <a href="http://www.europython.eu/">EuroPython 2009</a>
  and an editorial by me,
  and you have a complete issue!
  If you do not find Python Magazine
  sitting on your local newsstand,
  then I hope you will avail yourself of a subscription
  and, as always, let me know what topics
  you would like to see covered in future issues.
  Enjoy!
