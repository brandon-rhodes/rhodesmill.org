Now that the excitement
of PyCon 2009 is over,
it is time for me to finish this brief series of blog posts
on watermarking PDF files.
In the
<a href="/brandon/2009/graphicsmagick-saved-the-day/"
   >first post I outlined how GraphicsMagick and Adobe Reader</a>
proved essential to the project
for their ability to produce correct PDF files
and then help me verify their correctness.
The
<a href="/brandon/2009/pdf-watermark-margins/"
   >second post showed how an image can be applied as a watermark</a>
using the <a href="http://www.pdfhacks.com/pdftk/">pdftk</a>
PDF Toolkit utility.
The resulting watermark,
after some margins had been added using a Python script,
looked rather attractive:
</p>
<div class="figure">

><img src="http://rhodesmill.org/brandon/static/2009/wmark2.png"
alt="Watermark with margins" />
</a><p><strong>Watermarked page (click for PDF).</strong>
The light blue design is a PDF file
that <tt>pdftk</tt> resizes and centers
on the target document.</p>
</div>
<p>
My last challenge was that, on certain pages,
the watermark we were using
had to be turned upside down.
“Simple,” I thought, “I'll use <tt>pdftk</tt>
to turn the watermark over before applying it!”
I just had to process the watermark image
with the letter <tt>S</tt> (“south”),
which tells <tt>pdftk</tt> to rotate the image by 180°,
and then use the result as the watermark:
</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="err">$</span> <span class="n">pdftk</span> <span class="n">arecibo2</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">pdf</span> <span class="n">cat</span> <span class="mi">1</span><span class="n">S</span> <span class="n">output</span> <span class="n">arecibo3</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">pdf</span>

</a><p><strong>Upside-down watermark (click for PDF).</strong>
Whoops! After turning the watermark upside down,
<tt>pdftk</tt> lost the ability to properly center it.</p>
</div>
<!--more-->
<p>
Actually, the situation with my real customer's documents
was even worse than in this artifical example:
the real watermark was a bit smaller,
and positioned differently,
such that it actually got moved <i>entirely</i> off of the page
thanks to this misplacement bug in <tt>pdftk</tt>!
So I did not even start my investigation
with the knowledge that the watermark was misplaced;
for all I knew, it was simply missing from the output file.
</p>
<p>
That is why I got to spend an afternoon
with some coffee and the
<a href="http://www.adobe.com/devnet/pdf/pdf_reference.html"
   >PDF specification</a>
(thank you, Adobe web site!)
examining the raw files for myself
to discover what had happened.
</p>
<p>
Actually, <tt>pdftk</tt> proved indispensable
even while I was investigating its own misbehavior!
It was its <tt>uncompress</tt> command
that made the internals of the PDF files visible to my text editor.
The important difference turned out to be in a simple instruction,
which you can see for yourself
if you use <tt>pdftk</tt> to uncompress
the two PDF files that are linked to from the above images,
and then use <tt>diff</tt> <tt>-u</tt> to compare them:
</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre> <span class="n">q</span>
<span class="o">-</span><span class="n">q</span> <span class="mf">8.52</span> <span class="mi">0</span> <span class="mi">0</span> <span class="mf">8.52</span> <span class="mf">208.06</span> <span class="mf">85.16</span> <span class="n">cm</span> <span class="o">/</span><span class="n">Xi0</span> <span class="n">Do</span> <span class="n">Q</span>
<span class="o">+</span><span class="n">q</span> <span class="o">-</span><span class="mf">8.52</span> <span class="mi">0</span> <span class="mi">0</span> <span class="o">-</span><span class="mf">8.52</span> <span class="mf">574.26</span> <span class="mf">877.16</span> <span class="n">cm</span> <span class="o">/</span><span class="n">Xi0</span> <span class="n">Do</span> <span class="n">Q</span>
 <span class="n">Q</span></pre></div>

<p>
Here, <tt>diff</tt> is using
the leading <tt>-</tt> and <tt>+</tt> characters
to indicate that the first long line has been removed
and replaced with the second.
The numbers that you see are a coordinate matrix
that specifies where the watermark image
is being placed on the page.
What has happened is that the offsets
for the upside down watermark
are wrong —
and are wrong by <i>exactly</i> the size
of the margins that we added in the previous blog post!
</p>
<p>
The problem quickly became clear,
once I drew some boxes on graph paper and did some sums.
Very nearly every PDF file in existence
has a bounding box whose lower-left coordinates are (0,0).
But in the previous blog post in this series,
we quickly added margins to our PDF
by adjusting these coordinates outward so that they lay
at the very uncommon values of (-10,-10).
You can check this by running the wonderful <tt>pdfinfo</tt> command
against the
<a href="http://rhodesmill.org/brandon/static/2009/arecibo2.pdf"
   >arecibo2.pdf</a>
file yourself:
</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="err">$</span> <span class="n">pdfinfo</span> <span class="o">-</span><span class="n">box</span> <span class="n">arecibo2</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">pdf</span>
<span class="p">...</span>
<span class="n">Page</span> <span class="n">size</span><span class="o">:</span>      <span class="mi">43</span> <span class="n">x</span> <span class="mi">93</span> <span class="n">pts</span>
<span class="p">...</span>
<span class="nl">CropBox:</span>          <span class="o">-</span><span class="mf">10.00</span>   <span class="o">-</span><span class="mf">10.00</span>    <span class="mf">33.00</span>    <span class="mf">83.00</span>
<span class="p">...</span></pre></div>

<p>
When we ask <tt>pdftk</tt> to apply a watermark that is right side up,
all is well.
But when we apply a watermark upside down,
<tt>pdftk</tt> forgets to apply a negative sign
to our negative bounding box coordinates,
and they wind up shifting the image
in the opposite direction.
</p>
<p>
It took me more than an hour of crazy experiments
before I realized that I could work around the bug quite simply
by turning the <i>document</i> upside down with <tt>pdftk</tt>,
applying the watermark,
and then turning the document upright again!
I had spent time looking for a complicated solution
that would fool <tt>pdftk</tt> into doing the right thing,
when all I needed to do
was to step back and figure out how to avoid
the whole problem of upside down watermarks in the first place.
How? With upside down documents!

Why turn your watermark over once,
when you can turn your whole document over twice instead?
The obvious solution always takes so long to discover.</p>
