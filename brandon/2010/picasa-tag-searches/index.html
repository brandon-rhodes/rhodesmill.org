  Well, drat.
</p>
<p>
  Several images disappeared from the
  <a href="http://www.ourfreshworld.com/">Our Fresh World</a>
  green-building web site
  because Google changed their Picasa API recently —
  and I must not be subscribed to the proper mailing list or blog
  to have been warned ahead of time.
  Where are incompatible Google API tweaks announced?

<p>
  The site owner and his photographer use
  <a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/">Picasa web albums</a>
  to upload, edit, and maintain their image collection.
  They simply give special tags to their favorite photos,
  and my application code then knows
  that it is supposed to display those photos on the web site.
  I almost used <a href="http://flickr.com/">Flickr</a>
  for this application,
  both because I am an avid Flickr user myself
  and because I consider its web interface more usable.
  But, perhaps predictably, Picasa had the much stronger search API —
  whereas you can either ask Flickr for the photos in a particular set,
  <i>or</i> ask for all of someone's photos that share a particular tag,
  Picasa lets you can combine the two queries
  and ask for only the photos that are in a particular set
  <i>and</i> that also share a specific tag.
  And since search is what attaches pictures to this web site,
  Picasa was my choice.
</p>
<p>
  All was going well,
  with each page getting populated by searches like:
</p>
<pre>http://picasaweb.google.com/data/feed/api/user/<i>name</i><br/>?kind=photo&tag=solar-power</pre>
<p>
  Then I received an email from the site owner,
  complaining that many of the photographs had disappeared!
  After seeing some complaints in the Picasa forums
  about recent versions of the user interface
  treating certain “special characters” in tags as spaces instead,
  I suddenly wondered whether the hyphen in several of our tags
  (like the “solar-power” tag in the URL above)
  was the cause of our trouble.
  I adjusted my code so that this search became:
</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="nl">http:</span><span class="c1">//picasaweb.google.com/…?kind=photo&amp;tag=solar+power</span></pre></div>

<p>
  And, voilà, the images returned and were again visible!
  Does anyone know what forum or blog I should have been following
  to be informed of this critical change by Google?
  It is dismaying to have a site break in front of a customer
  when the very reason that I chose a Google product
  was because of their powerful API for integrating my application.
