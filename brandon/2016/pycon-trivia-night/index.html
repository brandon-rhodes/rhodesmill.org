<p>At PyCon&nbsp;2016 it was my honor,
for a third year in a row,
to host a Trivia Dinner on the first evening of the conference!
This year’s venue was the storied
<a class="reference external" href="http://www.mcmenamins.com/CrystalBallroom">Crystal Ballroom</a>,
a music venue in Downtown Portland’s west end.
To make sure that our event took full advantage of the big stage,
I booked the <a class="reference external" href="http://adcap.biz/">Adventure Capitalists</a>,
who followed up the trivia dinner
with a rousing set of punk startup tunes:</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Have a conference pass?

<script async src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script><p>Last year’s trivia night questions
focused on such exciting topics as PEP-8 and Python&nbsp;3,
but it turns out that these were fraught topics
about which most of the audience were not very familiar.
So I made a promise:
the PyCon&nbsp;2016 trivia night would be all Python&nbsp;2, all the time!
The questions below dive into and celebrate
the retro roots of the legacy Python language.</p>
<p>With the dinner complete,
I can now reveal the questions and answers!
I will list the questions first,
in case any readers want to tackle them themselves
without the danger of the answers scrolling too quickly into view.
Next, I will list the teams and their scores.
Finally, I will finish with the answers.</p>

<h2>First Round Answers</h2>
<ol class="arabic" start="0">
<li><p class="first">A trailing comma suppresses Python’s usual habit of adding a newline
at the end of the material that it prints.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">Printing <tt class="docutils literal">&gt;&gt;None</tt> prints to <tt class="docutils literal">sys.stdout</tt> without the
inconvenience of making you import <tt class="docutils literal">sys</tt> and name <tt class="docutils literal">stdout</tt>
directly in your code. This will strike the modern Python programmer
as needlessly obscure, and a poor trade-off: if a programmer decides
to use the feature, then almost every other programmer reading the
code will have to go consult the rules to remember the effect.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">This question tested knowledge of Python’s string quoting and
escaping, which it shares with many other languages. Three basic
rules need to be grasped to answer this question. First: many
dangerous or unusual characters can be safely typed in a Python
string constant by preceding them with a backslash — so that the
single quote in the middle of <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">'what\'s</span> up'</tt> is understood by
Python to be a simple literal single quote, and not your attempt to
end the string yet. Second: these rules remain the same whether or
not the current string’s quoting needs them. There is nothing special
about a single quote in a double-quoted string, so <tt class="docutils literal">&quot;what's up&quot;</tt> is
perfectly safe, but Python likes keeping rules symmetric and so
<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">&quot;what\'s</span> up&quot;</tt> is allowed too. Third, and most dismayingly: if you
put a backslash in front of a character that does <em>not</em> create a
recognized backslash code, then instead of giving you an error,
Python simply assumes you want a backslash in the middle of your
string. This is C’s behavior, but an example of poor design: most
users would benefit from an exception of they type an unknown escape
code, since they can always double up the backslash to make their
intention clear and be explicit rather than implicit.</p>
<p>Taking the three elements in <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">&quot;\`\'\&quot;&quot;</span></tt> from right to left:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><tt class="docutils literal">\&quot;</tt> is the simplest case: you want a double-quote in a
doubly-quoted string, so you escape it, adding a single double
quote character to your string.</li>
<li><tt class="docutils literal">\'</tt> is a bit more of a stretch, because the <tt class="docutils literal">\</tt> is optional:
you don’t really need it, so what will Python do? As explained
above, backslash codes work whether the current string needs them
or not, so this also adds only a single quote character to our
string.</li>
<li><tt class="docutils literal">\`</tt> is the outlier. Because a backtick is never special or
dangerous inside a Python string, no matter how it is quoted, the
language does not bother to define <tt class="docutils literal">\`</tt> as meaning anything. Since
it is not a recognized escape code, the language assumes you really
wanted a backslash and backtick: two characters.</li>
</ul>
<p>So the resulting string (when written without quotes or escaping,
since that would confuse things again!) is <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">\`'&quot;</span></tt> which is 4
characters long.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">A bad habit of Python&nbsp;2 was taking unlike things and giving them
names with exactly the same spelling — and a particular habit was
giving modules the name of their most useful class. Both <tt class="docutils literal">StringIO</tt>
and <tt class="docutils literal">UserDict</tt> were the names of both a module and also of the
class that you usually wanted inside. But <tt class="docutils literal">Fraction</tt> came from the
<tt class="docutils literal">fractions</tt> module, differentiating the module name with both case
and pluralization.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">According to the Python Reference, a tab character always represents
at least one space, and adds enough spaces to the line to bring the
cursor to a position that is a multiple of&nbsp;8.  It therefore can range
from meaning 1&nbsp;space to meaning 8&nbsp;spaces.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">I had always thought that <tt class="docutils literal">j</tt> was the single letter that could turn
a number like <tt class="docutils literal">4</tt> into the imaginary number <tt class="docutils literal">4j</tt>, but it turns
out that the language standard also permits <tt class="docutils literal">4J</tt>.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">The Python community learned early on that we needed pickling and
string I/O to happen quickly, but profiling technology matured late
in the history of Python&nbsp;2, so <tt class="docutils literal">cProfile</tt> was the last of the three
modules added.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">Famously, Python took the percent-formatting conventions that the
C&nbsp;language had locked up inside the <tt class="docutils literal">printf()</tt> and <tt class="docutils literal">sprintf()</tt>
families of library functions and elevated it to an operator: the
first Python string interpolation mechanism was <tt class="docutils literal">%</tt> interpolation.</p>

<h2>Second Round Answers</h2>
<ol class="arabic" start="0">
<li><p class="first">There are many languages that use <tt class="docutils literal">&gt;&gt;</tt> to direct output to a
specific file. But according to the BDFL quote in PEP-214, only four
were known to him as predecessors, and therefore qualify as true
influences on Python and not simply coincidences: “sh, awk, Perl, and
C++.”</p>
<p><a class="reference external" href="https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0214/">https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0214/</a></p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">Bell Laboratories programmers in the early 1970s seem to have found
it easier to think in octal than in hexadecimal, which makes sense:
we already come to programming familiar with the numbers 0 through&nbsp;7,
while numbers like “B” and “C” can take a long time to get used
to. (Without stopping to count, can you state their values?) So octal
was chosen as the base in which difficult-to-type character codes
could be written, and three octal digits are all that you need to
specify an 8-bit character: once the language is done reading up to
three digits following a backslash, it stops and assumes the rest of
the string is normal. So <tt class="docutils literal">'\12345'</tt> is a single character <tt class="docutils literal">\123</tt>
(also known as capital&nbsp;S) followed by the digit <tt class="docutils literal">4</tt> and the digit
<tt class="docutils literal">5</tt>. The string <tt class="docutils literal">S45</tt> has the length&nbsp;3.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">This question is all sorts of fun, because the documentation has been
leading you wrong all of these years. You have probably never used a
keyword to name the first argument to <tt class="docutils literal">list()</tt>. After all, the
convention that we can pass an initial value to all built-in types —
think of calls like <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">int('12')</span></tt> and <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">tuple([3,</span> 4, 5])</tt> — is so
pervasive that we never feel the need to be more explicit about the
purpose of those arguments. But we may have seen a dozen times, when
running <tt class="docutils literal">pydoc list</tt> to remember a method name, the keyword
argument <tt class="docutils literal">iterable</tt> advertized for the constructor:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="n">Help</span> <span class="n">on</span> <span class="n">class</span> <span class="n">list</span> <span class="n">in</span> <span class="n">module</span> <span class="n">__builtin__</span><span class="o">:</span>

<span class="n">class</span> <span class="n">list</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">object</span><span class="p">)</span>
 <span class="o">|</span>  <span class="n">list</span><span class="p">()</span> <span class="o">-&gt;</span> <span class="n">new</span> <span class="n">empty</span> <span class="n">list</span>
 <span class="o">|</span>  <span class="n">list</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">iterable</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="o">-&gt;</span> <span class="n">new</span> <span class="n">list</span> <span class="n">initialized</span> <span class="n">from</span> <span class="n">iterable</span><span class="err">&#39;</span><span class="n">s</span> <span class="n">items</span>
 <span class="o">|</span>  <span class="p">...</span></pre></div>

<p>But the documentation is wrong! In the C code of the <tt class="docutils literal">list()</tt>
initializer, the keyword argument is called <tt class="docutils literal">sequence</tt>, and you can
verify this by calling it with this keyword argument yourself.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">The six “rich comparison” method names are:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="n">__eq__</span><span class="p">()</span> <span class="n">__ne__</span><span class="p">()</span> <span class="n">__gt__</span><span class="p">()</span> <span class="n">__lt__</span><span class="p">()</span> <span class="n">__ge__</span><span class="p">()</span> <span class="n">__le__</span><span class="p">()</span></pre></div>

<p>I gave ½ point if a team knew most of them but got one or two wrong,
and also ½ point if a team knew them all but forgot to put dunders
around them.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">While several other languages might also use these abbreviations for
“greater than,” “less than,” and so on, they all go back to a common
ancestor: the naming convention comes from Fortran. As PEP-207 says,
“You gotta love the Fortran heritage.”</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">Okay, this is fun: Python&nbsp;2 has a special syntax for evaluating an
expression and turning it into a string!  This is probably the most
Perl-like feature of Python&nbsp;2’s syntax, the place where it most
severely goes off of the rails and uses obscure characters for
something that could more easily (and readably!) spelled out. Since
<tt class="docutils literal">`3 * 4`</tt> will evaluate to the string <tt class="docutils literal">'12'</tt>, multiplying the result
by two results in the string <tt class="docutils literal">'1212'</tt>.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">And this question is even more fun: to answer it, you need to know
that the <em>kind</em> of string generated by putting backticks around an
expression is not a <tt class="docutils literal">str()</tt> string, but a <tt class="docutils literal">repr()</tt> string! So
after the multiplication by 3 has produced the characters <tt class="docutils literal">202020</tt>,
the outer pair of backticks go to work by running <tt class="docutils literal">repr()</tt> which
slaps a pair of single quotes around those characters. Multiplying
this by 2 gives the final string (if we write it out without quotes,
to keep things simple):</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="err">&#39;</span><span class="mi">202020</span><span class="err">&#39;&#39;</span><span class="mi">202020</span><span class="err">&#39;</span></pre></div>

<p>Oh, and, yes: legacy Python thought its backtick mechanism was so
important that people would be using backticks <em>inside</em> of backticks,
so the parser is carefully crafted to correctly handle concentric
backticks. This expression is not, as many of you had fondly hoped, a
syntax error!</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">Python&nbsp;2.4, believe it or not, went to the trouble of adding a whole
new string interpolation mechanism that no one ever uses: the
<tt class="docutils literal">string.Template</tt> class! It accepts strings like <tt class="docutils literal">'Hello,
$name!'</tt> that use a <tt class="docutils literal">$</tt> to mark each place that a value should be
interpolated. Python&nbsp;2 had a habit of introducing more string
interpolation mechanisms than the community would actually decide to
use, and there are hints that Python&nbsp;3 is making plans to continue
that tradition.</p>

</li>
<li><p class="first">Like the same question in the first round, this tests whether you
know the backslash escape codes common to the entire family of

to old teletypes) and <tt class="docutils literal">\b</tt> is backspace, so each of those
two-character escape sequences in the written string represent one
real character apiece. But <tt class="docutils literal">\c</tt> does not mean anything special, so it
remains the two characters backslash and <em>c</em>. So the resulting string
is 4 bytes long.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">In this case, the docstring shown to you by <tt class="docutils literal">pydoc</tt> will not have led
you astray, if you happened to remember it. The second argument has
the obvious name <tt class="docutils literal">base</tt> since it lets you specify whether a string
you have supplied is expected to be in base&nbsp;8, or base&nbsp;10, or base&nbsp;16
or whatever. The first argument is more obscurely named: the
initializer specifying the integer’s value is named <tt class="docutils literal">x</tt>. I gave ½
point if a team knew one but not the other.</p>

<li><p class="first">The <tt class="docutils literal">Telnet</tt> class lives inside of the <tt class="docutils literal">telnetlib</tt> module instead of
simply living inside of a module of the same name as itself.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">Believe it or not, the Reference Manual for Python&nbsp;2 consistently
uses ‘singleton’ as the technical term for a tuple of length one.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">In Python 2.7, <tt class="docutils literal">sys.version_info()</tt> stopped returning a plain tuple
that supported only item access, and started returning a named tuple
whose elements could also be fetched through attributes like <tt class="docutils literal">.major</tt>
and <tt class="docutils literal">.minor</tt>. I also gave credit if a team’s answer sheet named the
specific named-tuple type that gets returned — which just happens to
be the type <tt class="docutils literal">sys.version_info</tt>!</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">The first-ever <tt class="docutils literal">__future__</tt> directive was:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="n">from</span> <span class="n">__future__</span> <span class="n">import</span> <span class="n">nested_scopes</span></pre></div>

<p>Nested scopes were considered dangerous enough that they needed to be
an opt-in feature for an entire Python version before they became
official.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">The powerful language feature introduced in Python&nbsp;2.4 that was going
to make possible “all sorts of new and shiny evil” is, startlingly
enough, the fact that “<tt class="docutils literal">eval()</tt> now accepts any form of object that
acts as a mapping as its argument for locals.”  Once again, a new
feature that was apparently expected to open up whole new ways of
using Python wound up going almost entirely unused — I cannot
remember once, in even the most magic-ridden Python code, ever having
seen this superpower taken advantage of.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">From the copy of the Zen of Python that you re-read on your beach
vacation as the surf crashes in the background: “In the face of
ambiguity, refuse the temptation to <em>guess</em>.”</p>
