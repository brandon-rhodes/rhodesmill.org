Several programs that are favorites of mine
or that I use frequenly for my work
are not supported as part of
<A HREF="http://www.redhat.com/">Red Hat Software</A>'s offical distributions,
so I have packaged them myself
and contributed them to Red Hat's 
<A HREF="ftp://ftp.redhat.com/pub/contrib/">contrib/</A> directory.
For an independent listing of my contribution,
see <A HREF="http://rufus.w3.org/linux/RPM/Brandon_Craig_Rhodes_(bcrhodes@cc.gatech.edu).html">my entry</A>
on the excellent <A HREF="http://rufus.w3.org/linux/RPM/">RPM Repository</A>.

<DD>This is an IP transaction auditing tool
 that I use to monitor accesses to the machines I administer.
 I have split it into two components:
 the sniffer itself
 (which you will probably need installed on only one machine per subnet),
 and the collection of commands it comes with for scanning its log files
 (which you might want to install on many machines).

<DD>XEphem should be used by every astronomer.
 Many amateur astronomers spend money for PC-based systems,
 while this free application outperforms almost all of them!
 (Exception: it will not do gravitational dynamics simulations,
  but they are almost irrelevant to the needs of an observer
  with access to up-to-date ephemeri.)
 I think every Red Hat user should try this package out.
 <P>
 The <I>ppm</I> star database is included in a separate RPM:
 it is an optional and very large star catalog
 that can be used by <I>XEphem</I>.</P>

<DD>I am a fan and regular user of <A HREF="http://www.python.org">Python</A>.
 This is the most recent version,
 newer than the 1.4 currently being shipped with Red Hat 5.0.
 When making these packages I attempted to provide a more complete
 range of functionality than does Red Hat,
 while carefully retaining Red Hat's package structure.
 In particular I compiled all of the libraries that could possibly be useful
 but that did not require other software;
 these are in the `extralibs' package.
<P>
 Most sigificantly,
 I compiled the Python interpreter with <B>threads</B> enabled,
 taking advantage of the C library and kernel modifications
 available with Red Hat 5.0.
 This incurs a performance penalty for nonthreaded applications
 since the interpreter performs all of its operations in a thread-safe manner,
 but this will probably not be noticable
 since Python 1.5 itself is notably faster than 1.4 was.

<DD>Scotty is a collection of network protocol routines
 incorporated into the Tcl scripting language.
 I will probably wind up using Python for my ``real'' network applications,
 since it is faster and has real data structures,
 but I went ahead and packaged this as well.

 that is portable across many brands of Unix.

<DD>Sometime around the seventies,
 the eminent computer scientist Donald Knuth became dissatisfied
 with the manner in which computer programming languages
 force us to organize our code.
 Actually the problem was more specific:
 he was using Pascal,
 which forces your application, however large,
 to be expressed as a single program module.
 A subroutine is coded inside the routine that calls it,
 right smack in between its parent's variable declarations and code!
 So in a large program there could be thousands of lines separating
 the variables of a high-level procedure with its code.
 We are lucky that such an unfortunate language
 did not drive <NOBR>Dr. Knuth</NOBR> out of computing altogether.
 <P>
 What Knuth did instead
 was to develop the doctrine of ``literate programming,''
 along with an implementation for Pascal that was called <I>Web</I>.
 His scheme contains two ingredients:
 first,
 you express a program hierarchically,
 breaking it into concentric levels of detail
 that allow you to view high level structures
 without having them interrupted by their lengthy components;
 second,
 you write a description of what each of these pieces of code does.
 This structure can then be collapsed into compilable code,
 or be formatted and printed.
 The <I>Web</I> system was used by Knuth to create the current version
 of the widely used TeX program.
 <P>
 <I>CWeb</I> is another implementation
 of the literate programming concept,
 written by Silvio Levy and <NOBR>Dr. Knuth</NOBR>.
 I would estimate that literate programming
 is probably only half as useful for writing C
 as it was for Pascal:
 since C compilers let you combine multiple source files
 and make you write all functions in the external scope,
 they avoid the horrible mess that Pascal made of a large project.
 <P>
 But even though C is more convenient,
 <I>cweb</I> still seems like a good idea.
 Putting my verbal commentary on a piece of C code into a nearby comment -
 a fragment of text stuck inside of slashes and stars -
 seems somewhat lopsided to me.
 So I am very attracted to the idea of a system
 that places code and description on an equal footing;
 thus I have packaged <I>CWeb</I> and plan to use it
 the next time I write C code.

<DD>The Simplified Wrapper and Interface Generator is a magnificent tool
 that automatically builds interfaces to collections of C or C++ functions
 from any one of several scripting languages.
 It currently supports Python, Tcl, Perl, and Guile.
 <P>
 The individual who made the RPM for Swig 1.1p3
 incorrectly named the packages with the version number `1.3p1'.
 So this package in fact represents the most recent version.

<DD>This is the most recent authorized edition
 of the venerable and original text adventure game.
 I recommend playing it late at night in a dark room,
 as this enhances its atmosphere considerably;
 if you play it in a lighted room or office
 you are likely to forget that caves are dark
 and imperfectly lit by your latern.

<DD>The GNU remote configuration engine <I>CFEngine</I>
 is a powerful tool for locally or remotely maintaining the configuration
 of a Unix system.
 It allows you to specify checks and repairs
 related to filesystems, files, daemons, timezone,
 and several other aspects of your systems.
 In particular it is an excellent way to make sure
 that the permissions of individual files and of whole hierarchies
 stay consistent with your security policies.</P> -->
