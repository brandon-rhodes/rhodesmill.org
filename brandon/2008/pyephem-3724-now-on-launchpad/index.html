I have decided to give my
<a href="http://rhodesmill.org/pyephem">PyEphem
astronomy library for Python</a>
a public source code repository,
an open forum for user questions,
and a bug tracker where my users
can see the progress of their bug reports out in the open
rather than having them scattered across our email inboxes.
To accomplish all of this,
I simply registered PyEphem with
<a href="http://launchpad.net/">Launchpad</a>,
a site built to host software projects
that is already used by several projects for which I have great respect.
</p>

<p>
Because users might become confused
now that PyEphem is spread across <i>three</i> web sites —
the home page is here at rhodesmill.org,
releases are posted over at the
<a href="http://www.python.org/pypi">Python Package Index</a>,
and, again, the development project is now hosted at Launchpad —
I have completely
<a href="http://rhodesmill.org/pyephem">redesigned the PyEphem home
page</a> with the goal of making the three-site distinction
clear, coherent, and easy to navigate.
The new home page and documentation
are generated by the wonderful
<a href="http://sphinx.pocoo.org/">Sphinx documentation engine</a>,
and I am still thrilled about how pretty my code samples look
(check out the one on the PyEphem home page!)
now that Sphinx is coloring them in with the renowned
<a href="http://pygments.org/">Pygments</a> system.
</p>

<p>
I have simultaneously released a new version of PyEphem
that includes the new Sphinx-based documentation,
along with several important fixes to the software itself.
From now on,
rather than cluttering my own blog
with every minor version of PyEphem that I might release,
fans of the software should visit its
<a href="https://launchpad.net/pyephem/+announcements">News and
announcements</a> page on Launchpad
and subscribe themselves to its
<a href="http://feeds.launchpad.net/pyephem/announcements.atom">Atom/RSS
feed</a>.
You will still see the project mentioned here
whenever a technical or scientific issue
becomes interesting enough for me to write about;
but the audience of astronomers and hobbyists
who just need to know when the next version is released
should not have to wade through my blog to do so!
</p>

<p>
My users have already begun transferring
their questions and problems to Lauchpad,
and I look forward to offering much greater accountability
through a fully public development process.
