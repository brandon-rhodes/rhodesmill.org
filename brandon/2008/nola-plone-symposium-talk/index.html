I have delivered my “Zope 3 Component Architecture” talk
to the <a href="http://plone.org/events/regional/nola08">2008 North American
Plone Symposium</a> meeting here in New Orleans.
I want to thank the folks at
<a href="http://enfoldsystems.com/">Enfold Systems</a>
both for hosting the Symposium, inviting me to speak,
and for generously making it possible for me to attend!
Here are my slides:

They had asked me to attend so that I could present
the <a href="http://rhodesmill.org/brandon/adapters/">Using Grok
to Walk Like a Duck</a> talk that I gave at PyCon 2008
back in March.
They changed the title, I suppose, to better highlight
why it would be of interest to the Plone community;
but the change actually helped me to rethink the presentation.
I wound up using only the first half of my PyCon slides.
For the second half of the talk,
which at PyCon had consisted of a crazy sequence
of hints and tips about using adapters in your own applications,
I instead did a much more successful series of slides
about how adapters are actually used in Zope 3
to suit up objects for presentation on the web.
I think this made the idea more concrete,
and thus much easier to understand
for people seeing adapters for the first time.
</p>
<p>
The talk was well enough received
that I should perhaps think seriously about finding further opportunities
to share Zope 3 technologies with the Plone community.
