On Sunday afternoon I released a new version of <a href="http://rhodesmill.org/pyephem/">PyEphem</a>, which is available from the Python Package Index as <a href="http://pypi.python.org/pypi/pyephem/3.7.2.2">version 3.7.2.2</a>!  I want to thank the users who spurred its development&nbsp;— in particular, <a href="http://asemonline.org/archives/category/members-pages/john-ducheks-pages/">John Duchek</a> of the Astronomical Society of Eastern Missouri encouraged me both to create the new moon-phase functions, and, as I <a href="http://rhodesmill.org/brandon/2007/pyephem-available-for-windows/">announced</a> several weeks ago, to finally make PyEphem available in binary form for Windows.  Thanks, John!

PyEphem now also includes a small database of world cities, so that people living near one can simply call <tt>ephem.city('Boston')</tt> to get their longitude, latitude, and elevation, rather than having to look up the numbers themselves.
