</table><p>I have played with Python’s
<a href="http://docs.sympy.org/latest/index.html">SymPy symbolic math library</a> before,
but for the first time last week I used it to solve a real problem!
In the process I had to confront three errors
in my understanding of how SymPy works:</p>
<ol>
<li>I had somehow imagined that SymPy was secretly storing
all the equations I was writing
and would use them automatically later.</li>
<li>I thought I could convince SymPy to eliminate intermediate symbols.</li>
<li>I thought each variable in my problem needed to be a SymPy symbol.</li>
</ol>
<p>While working through these misunderstandings to a solution,
I ran across two features that made SymPy’s results
easier to use in my Python code than I had expected!</p>
<ol>
<li>SymPy not only supports fancy formatting of math formulae,
but can print them as pure Python expressions
ready to be pasted into a Python program.</li>
<li>SymPy can perform subexpression elimination
to prevent your code
from computing any sub-result twice.</li>
</ol>
<p>The sections of this post tackle each of the items above in turn.<!--more--></p>
<h2 id="Why-did-I-wind-up-enlisting-SymPy?">Why did I wind up enlisting SymPy?<a class="anchor-link" href="#Why-did-I-wind-up-enlisting-SymPy?">&#182;</a></h2><p>The gradual elaboration of my
<a href="http://rhodesmill.org/skyfield/">Python astronomy library Skyfield</a>
has now reached the verge of producing star charts.
To produce a chart,
the unit vectors for the sky full of stars
need to be rotated
so that the center of the chart
winds up pointing along one of the coordinate system’s axes.</p>
<p>The naive approach requires two fraught crossings
of the boundary
between the clean and confident realm of Cartesian coordinates
and the more troubled realm of spherical coordinates.
Given the position $(x, y, z)$ of the star one wants
at the center of the chart,
the first step is determining its spherical longitude and latitude —
the angle $\phi$ of the vector around the $xy$ plane
and its angle $\theta$ above or below the $xy$ plane:</p>
$$ \eqalign{ \phi &amp;= \tan^{-1}(y, x) \cr \theta &amp;= \sin^{-1}(z) } $$<p>These two angles are then used to build two matrices.
The first rotates any star $-\phi$ around the $z$-axis.</p>

<p>Given an input star's position vector $x_i, y_i, z_i$,
the result of multiplication by these matrices
will be an output vector $x_o, y_o, z_o$
where the stars that were originally grouped around the target star in the sky
will now be neatly grouped about the top of the $+z$ axis
and are ready for projection on to the flat surface of a star chart.</p>
<h2 id="Here-be-dragons">Here be dragons<a class="anchor-link" href="#Here-be-dragons">&#182;</a></h2><p>But it’s inelegant to implement the above formulae directly,
because they involve a sharp descent
from the bright heights of Cartesian coordinates
into the dim sublunary world of spherical coordinates.</p>
<p>The brilliance of Cartesian coordinates
is the admirable symmetry
with which they freight their coordinates with significance.
Whatever the values of $x$ and $y$, for example,
an adjustment $\epsilon$ to $z$
will move the tip of the vector by the exact same amount —
whether the vector's length is a mere kilometer
or a parsec.</p>
<p>By contrast,
the significance of the spherical angle $\phi$
around the equator varies wildly.
Its effect is greatest
when the vector points along the sphere’s equator,
but drops all the way to zero —
it becomes meaningless
and its floating-point precision is <em>completely squandered</em> —
when the vector points at one of the poles.</p>
<p>And trigonometric functions themselves involve numerous subtleties
when implemented in floating point arithmetic on a computer.
I’m indebted to Skyfield contributor
<a href="https://github.com/JoshPaterson">Josh Paterson</a>
for bringing to my attention
William Kahan’s work on floating point precision
— see, for example, §12 “Mangled Angles”
of his paper
<a href="https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~wkahan/Mindless.pdf">How Futile are Mindless Assessments of Roundoff
in Floating-Point Computation</a>.</p>
<p>But I knew there was a way out.
Since the angles $\theta$ and $\phi$
are in this case derived from $x, y, z$ coordinates in the first place,
it should be possible to express the output vector
in terms of the inputs
using no trigonometry at all —
the angles can disappear entirely!</p>
<p>But I wasn’t eager to perform all the substitutions by hand,
so I turned to Python’s <code>SymPy</code> library.</p>
<h2 id="First-mistake:-thinking-there-was-global-state">First mistake: thinking there was global state<a class="anchor-link" href="#First-mistake:-thinking-there-was-global-state">&#182;</a></h2><p>While I know that well-written software
avoids maintaining global state,
SymPy was so similar to older systems I had experience with —
particularly Mathematica —
that as I typed each formula
I repeatedly imagined
that I was feeding knowledge into a central SymPy data store
from which it would draw conclusions.</p>
<p>But that's simply not how SymPy works.
When you say something like:</p>

<div class=" highlight hl-python3"><pre><span class="n">Eq</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">y</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">z</span> <span class="o">-</span> <span class="mi">2</span><span class="p">)</span></pre></div>


<div class="output">$\displaystyle y = z - 2$</div>

<p>— you are not enrolling this fact in a magical SymPy data store,
and SymPy will not remember the equation later
when you then ask it to solve for something:</p>

<div class=" highlight hl-python3"><pre><span class="n">solve</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">y</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">z</span><span class="p">)</span></pre></div>


<div class="output">$\displaystyle \left[ \right]$</div>

<p>The <code>solve()</code> routine here found no solutions,
because it doesn’t remember that I typed the earlier equation —
<code>solve()</code> is, in fact, a true function:
it knows only the information you provide as arguments.
The equation object needs to be provided
as one of the arguments to <code>solve()</code>:</p>

<div class=" highlight hl-python3"><pre><span class="n">solve</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">Eq</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">y</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">z</span> <span class="o">-</span> <span class="mi">2</span><span class="p">),</span> <span class="n">z</span><span class="p">)</span></pre></div>


<div class="output">$\displaystyle \left[ y + 2\right]$</div>

<p>It also did not help —
as I labored under the delusion
that I was slowly feeding new facts into SymPy —
that each time I should have written <code>Eq(a, b + 2)</code>
I instead tended to write <code>a = b + 2</code>
which, per the usual rules of Python assignment,
destroys the symbol <code>a</code> and replaces it with an expression object.
I suppose I should have been more careful
to actually read Sympy’s documentation straight through,
instead of dipping in to sample it —
especially given the fact that SymPy is a project whose
<a href="http://docs.sympy.org/latest/tutorial/index.html">Tutorial</a>
ominously puts the section “Gotchas” <em>ahead</em> of the section “Basic Operations”!</p>
<h2 id="Second-mistake:-I-though-I-could-convince-SymPy-to-eliminate-variables">Second mistake: I though I could convince SymPy to eliminate variables<a class="anchor-link" href="#Second-mistake:-I-though-I-could-convince-SymPy-to-eliminate-variables">&#182;</a></h2><p>I prefer thinking about trigonometry in the "forwards" direction:</p>
$$ z = sin(\theta) $$<p>It always feels backwards for the human,
rather than the machine,
to be in charge of flipping the equation around
to unnatural arc-trigonometry:</p>
$$ \theta = sin^{-1}(z) $$<p>SymPy was indeed willing to invert the trigonometry
when only two variables were involved:</p>

<div class=" highlight hl-python3"><pre><span class="n">solve</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">Eq</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">z</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">sin</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="err">𝜃</span><span class="p">)),</span> <span class="err">𝜃</span><span class="p">)</span></pre></div>


<div class="output">$\displaystyle \left[ \pi - \operatorname{asin}{\left(z \right)}, \  \operatorname{asin}{\left(z \right)}\right]$</div>

<p>The problem is that I never figured out how to ask SymPy
to eliminate intermediate variables that I wasn’t interested in —
in this case, I want the angles to disappear entirely
so that Cartesian outputs can be expressed directly
as functions of Cartesian inputs.
To take a simpler example,
I can’t figure out how to ask SymPy to eliminate $\theta$
from this system of two equations
so that the output $z_o$ is expressed directly as a function of $z$:</p>

<div class=" highlight hl-python3"><pre><span class="n">solve</span><span class="p">([</span>
    <span class="n">Eq</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">z</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">sin</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="err">𝜃</span><span class="p">)),</span>
    <span class="n">Eq</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">zo</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">cos</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="err">𝜃</span><span class="p">)),</span>
<span class="p">],</span> <span class="n">zo</span><span class="p">)</span></pre></div>


<div class="output">$\displaystyle \left\{ z_{o} : \cos{\left(\theta \right)}\right\}$</div>

<p>If SymPy does have the capacity to eliminate intermediate variables,
then several of hours of work with the library —
and numerous visits to Stack Overflow —
left me without any insight into how to accomplish it.</p>
<p><strong>Update:</strong> <a name="update">In December 2019,</a>
a correspondant emailed me with a solution!
When <code>solve()</code> is given not one but several variables to solve for,
it works to eliminate all of them
from the formulae that it returns.
So by throwing 𝜃 into the list of variables
but then ignoring the solutions for it
that are included in each output dictionary,
we are left purely with solutions for $z_o$
in terms of $z$:</p>

<div class="output">$\displaystyle \left\{- \sqrt{1 - z^{2}}, \sqrt{1 - z^{2}}\right\}$</div>

<h2 id="Third-mistake:-Thinking-everything-needed-to-be-a-SymPy-symbol">Third mistake: Thinking everything needed to be a SymPy symbol<a class="anchor-link" href="#Third-mistake:-Thinking-everything-needed-to-be-a-SymPy-symbol">&#182;</a></h2><p>The reason that I thrashed around trying to eliminate symbols was,
it turns out, because I had created too many!</p>
<p>I had expected that my angles $\theta$ and $\phi$
would be SymPy symbols in my Python code.
But as I tried to convince SymPy to eliminate them,
I stumbled on the approach
of treating <code>𝜃</code> and <code>𝜙</code> as plain Python names
for SymPy expression objects:</p>

<div class=" highlight hl-python3"><pre><span class="err">𝜃</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">asin</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">z</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="err">𝜙</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">atan2</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">y</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">x</span><span class="p">)</span></pre></div>

<p>The surprise came when I used these expressions to build a rotation matrix:</p>

<div class=" highlight hl-python3"><pre><span class="n">rot_axis3</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="o">-</span><span class="err">𝜙</span><span class="p">)</span></pre></div>


<div class="output">$\displaystyle \left[\begin{matrix}\frac{x}{\sqrt{x^{2} + y^{2}}} & - \frac{y}{\sqrt{x^{2} + y^{2}}} & 0\\\frac{y}{\sqrt{x^{2} + y^{2}}} & \frac{x}{\sqrt{x^{2} + y^{2}}} & 0\\0 & 0 & 1\end{matrix}\right]$</div>

<p>Amazing!
Without my even asking,
SymPy has gone ahead and applied a series of trigonometric identities
to rewrite the matrix so that it can be computed directly
from my Cartesian inputs.</p>
<p>All that was needed
was to express the complete coordinate transformation in Python,
confident that SymPy would simplify the result:</p>

<div class=" highlight hl-python3"><pre><span class="n">xo</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">yo</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">zo</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">rot_axis2</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="err">𝜋</span><span class="o">/</span><span class="mi">2</span><span class="o">-</span><span class="err">𝜃</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="o">*</span> <span class="n">rot_axis3</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="o">-</span><span class="err">𝜙</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="o">*</span> <span class="n">Matrix</span><span class="p">([</span><span class="n">xi</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">yi</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">zi</span><span class="p">])</span></pre></div>

<p>This produces a formula for the first output coordinate:</p>

<div class=" highlight hl-python3"><pre><span class="n">xo</span></pre></div>


<div class="output">$\displaystyle \frac{x x_{i} z}{\sqrt{x^{2} + y^{2}}} - \frac{y y_{i} z}{\sqrt{x^{2} + y^{2}}} - z_{i} \sqrt{1 - z^{2}}$</div>

<p>And the second:</p>

<div class=" highlight hl-python3"><pre><span class="n">yo</span></pre></div>


<div class="output">$\displaystyle \frac{x y_{i}}{\sqrt{x^{2} + y^{2}}} + \frac{x_{i} y}{\sqrt{x^{2} + y^{2}}}$</div>

<p>And the third:</p>

<div class=" highlight hl-python3"><pre><span class="n">zo</span></pre></div>


<div class="output">$\displaystyle \frac{x x_{i} \sqrt{1 - z^{2}}}{\sqrt{x^{2} + y^{2}}} - \frac{y y_{i} \sqrt{1 - z^{2}}}{\sqrt{x^{2} + y^{2}}} + z z_{i}$</div>

<p>I was done — I could now compute the rotated coordinates
without leaving the Cartesian domain!</p>
<h2 id="Icing-#1:-SymPy-can-print-Python-syntax">Icing #1: SymPy can print Python syntax<a class="anchor-link" href="#Icing-#1:-SymPy-can-print-Python-syntax">&#182;</a></h2><p>Next, I needed to substitute the formulae
back into my Python code.</p>
<p>With many mathematical libraries,
the procedure would have been tedious —
I would have had to manually type
each multiplication, addition, and <code>sqrt()</code>
into Python without committing even a single one of my typical sign errors.</p>
<p>But, happily, a stray <code>print()</code> that I’d run
had revealed a delightful property of SymPy:
while it’s capable of producing beautiful fully rendered math
when used in a Jupyter notebook,
when asked to print plain text it produces fully valid Python
for the entire mathematically expression!</p>

<div class=" highlight hl-python3"><pre><span class="nb">print</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">xo</span><span class="p">)</span></pre></div>

<pre class="output">
x*x_i*z/sqrt(x**2 + y**2) - y*y_i*z/sqrt(x**2 + y**2) - z_i*sqrt(1 - z**2)
</pre>
<p>I could paste the resulting expressions directly into Skyfield.</p>
<h2 id="Icing-#2:-SymPy-supports-sub-expression-elimination">Icing #2: SymPy supports sub-expression elimination<a class="anchor-link" href="#Icing-#2:-SymPy-supports-sub-expression-elimination">&#182;</a></h2><p>As you examined the output expressions, above,
you probably felt your redundancy hackles rising
as you noticed all of the repeated sub-expressions.
Pasting the three formulae into Python code
would result in a common value like <code>sqrt(x**2 + y**2)</code>
getting recomputed a half-dozen times.</p>
<p>Happily, I ran across another SymPy routine named <code>cse()</code>
which performs exactly the operation
I had been planning to do by hand —
it recognizes common sub-expressions and pulls them out:</p>

<div class=" highlight hl-python3"><pre><span class="n">common</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="n">xo</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">yo</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">zo</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">cse</span><span class="p">([</span><span class="n">xo</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">yo</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">zo</span><span class="p">],</span> <span class="n">numbered_symbols</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s">&#39;t&#39;</span><span class="p">))</span>

<pre class="output">
t0 = sqrt(1 - z**2)
t1 = 1/sqrt(x**2 + y**2)
t2 = t1*x
t3 = t2*x_i

xo = -t0*z_i + t3*z - t5*z
yo = t2*y_i + t4*x_i
zo = t0*t3 - t0*t5 + z*z_i
</pre>
<p>The result is Python code
that I can paste directly into Skyfield
without the temptation to perform any further tweaks —
letting me return to my star chart rendering
in the confidence that the underlying rotations have been computed flawlessly.</p>
