Throughout the course of my father's youth
he and his brother,
Alan,
buried at least five treasures on Nanny and Grandad's property.
They made a map for each treasure,
hiding them in books.
.P
Dad had to go to Massachusetts for two weeks
to take classes pertaining to his job,
and Mom decided to accompany him and make a vacation out of it.
They left on Sunday, February 4, 1990, after dropping me off at church,
and returned two weeks later (17 Feb 1990).
On the afternoon of Sunday, February 11,
I biked down to Nanny and Granddad's
in order to research Benedictine monks for a report.
I went down to the little house to
look them up in the 1911 Brittanica.
Just before 16:30
I opened volume 23 to pages 434 and 435.
Stuck between them
was a small note decorated with a skull and crossbones.
Tales of Dad's buried treasures flooded back into my mind,
as I opened the note,
which read as follows:

North, west, about 15 steps
to pine.  Then go north,

another pine will be on
your right. On the north
side of the tree about 2 ft.
away is a treasure!

I set out to find the treasure,
accompanied by Granddad.
Starting at the corner of the house
we proceeded to the biggest pine,
then fifteen paces northwest
where a smaller pine stood.
But there was no tree anywhere near
five paces northeast of the tree.
I guessed that a pine might have once been there,
and tried digging two feet north of where I thought it might have been,
but found nothing.
I brought Nanny down,
but she could not remember
a pine having been there.
.P
It was ventured that the comma between north and west meant
to go five steps north, then five steps east,
which could be construed to indicate a large, convenient nearby pine.
I found nothing when I dug two feet north of that,
and soon had to leave for home anyway,
as it was getting dark.
.P
The next weekend I went to Windy Gap with Young Life,
and I went to Disciple Now at the Grahm's the next weekend,
where I fell in their lake.
I was three weeks later,
on Saturday, March 3,
that Dad and I finally found time
to go down to attempt to find the treasure.
.P
We started at the corner of the house
and proceeded to the biggest pine.
Dad was surprised
that the distance to the second tree was
measured in steps instead of the more elegant measure of paces.
We went five steps northeast,
and Dad searched under the leaves for the remains of a stump.
He thought that the tree would have been immediately on the right,
less than arm's length away,
or else he would have instead given a more concise direction on the map.
We dug another hole a few feet down the hill from my first hole.
I went and got a second shovel and we both started digging.
We were digging out the island between the two holes
when Dad hit a coffie can, flipping its lid up.
Nanny was walking toward us,
and we called to her that we had found it.
After digging around it Dad and I pulled it out together.
It had been buried less than a foot downhill from my original hole.
.P
With Dad and Nanny carrying the tools and I carrying the treasure can
we proceeded up to the house.
Dad and Nanny put the tools in the basement
while I took the treasure up
and set it in the leaves
next to the brick path between the houses
to be opened.
Grandad,
who had a cold,
came outside to witness the event.
With Dad, Nanny, and Grandad standing around,
I took off the lid.

On top was a note, reading:
