<p>It often irks me
that the normal Python pattern for running the body of a loop <em>n</em> times
results in the allocation and destruction of <em>n</em> integer objects,
even if the body of the loop does not need them.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="c"># Creates one million integers</span>

<span class="k">for</span> <span class="n">i</span> <span class="ow">in</span> <span class="nb">range</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="mi">1000000</span><span class="p">):</span>
    <span class="k">print</span>

<span class="c"># Creates them one at a time</span>

<span class="k">for</span> <span class="n">i</span> <span class="ow">in</span> <span class="nb">xrange</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="mi">1000000</span><span class="p">):</span>
    <span class="k">print</span></pre></div>

<p>Yes, I know, you will rightly complain that I am too easily irked.
The <tt class="docutils literal">range()</tt> pattern is standard.
The pattern is simple.
The pattern is easy to read.
The implementation is really quite fast
compared to any real work that I might do in the loop.
And, in the bright future when we all use PyPy,
the extra million integer objects will be optimized away anyway.</p>
<!--more--><p>But the thought always remained with me that,
whatever the convenience of using a <tt class="docutils literal">range()</tt> in a <tt class="docutils literal">for</tt> loop,
it still <em>meant</em> something a little heavyhanded:
“create these million integers” for me to loop across.
So while in real life, of course,
I will keep writing my <tt class="docutils literal">for</tt> loops with <tt class="docutils literal">range()</tt>,
I wondered if there were an alternative with — shall we say —
less <em>semantic</em> overhead.</p>
<p>A first alternative, that still creates a list of length <em>n</em>
but without creating a million actual objects to loop across,
uses list multiplication to create a million-item list
that is simply a million references to the <em>same</em> item
(in this example, the innocuous value <tt class="docutils literal">None</tt>):</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="c"># Creates only the list object</span>

<span class="k">for</span> <span class="n">i</span> <span class="ow">in</span> <span class="p">[</span><span class="bp">None</span><span class="p">]</span> <span class="o">*</span> <span class="mi">1000000</span><span class="p">:</span>
    <span class="k">print</span></pre></div>

<p>Not only does this have the conceptual clarity
of creating only a single extra object for the sake of the iteration,
but some quick experiments with <tt class="docutils literal">timeit</tt>
suggests that this is noticeably faster than using <tt class="docutils literal">range()</tt>
though not quite as fast as using <tt class="docutils literal">xrange()</tt>.
But it still allocates a useless region of memory
whose size must be proportional to the number of iterations we need.</p>
<p>What if we want a solution that is better than O(n)
in the memory it allocates across its lifespan?
Well, had I written this blog post ten years ago,
I could have had a field day building a series
of increasingly complex options
that each used even fewer objects than the last.
One such possibility, just to give you a taste of what might have been,
is to start creating concentric loops:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="n">thousand_things</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="p">[</span><span class="bp">None</span><span class="p">]</span> <span class="o">*</span> <span class="mi">1000</span>
<span class="k">for</span> <span class="n">i</span> <span class="ow">in</span> <span class="n">thousand_things</span><span class="p">:</span>
    <span class="k">for</span> <span class="n">j</span> <span class="ow">in</span> <span class="n">thousand_things</span><span class="p">:</span>
        <span class="k">print</span></pre></div>

<p>Here the memory footprint drops to O(√n)
since we have only two lists of a thousand pointers.
Yes, I know, a thousand extra iterator objects will also be created —
one to keep up with each journey across the <tt class="docutils literal">thousand_things</tt> list
in the inner loop —
but that is still a vast improvement over a million-item list
sitting in memory.</p>
<p>Think of all the fun I would have had
bringing the problem down to O(log&nbsp;n)
by using a list of binary digits
that I decremented using simple list operations.</p>
<p>But it was not to be — because,
when I finally sat down this evening to play,
I discovered within a few minutes that the modern <tt class="docutils literal">itertools</tt> module
contains a solution that involves not even O(log&nbsp;n)
but actual O(1) memory usage!
Behold, the <tt class="docutils literal">repeat()</tt> iterator:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="c"># Gives us `None` a million times</span>
<span class="c"># without creating Python integers!</span>

<span class="kn">from</span> <span class="nn">itertools</span> <span class="kn">import</span> <span class="n">repeat</span>
<span class="k">for</span> <span class="n">x</span> <span class="ow">in</span> <span class="n">repeat</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="bp">None</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">1000000</span><span class="p">):</span>
    <span class="k">print</span></pre></div>

<p>For C&nbsp;Python, this method is the fastest
of the alternatives we have discussed,
as you can quickly verify if you do some <tt class="docutils literal">timeit</tt> experiments.
For those of you who are new to <tt class="docutils literal">timeit</tt>,
here is a simple command line to get you started:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="nv">$ </span>python -m timeit <span class="se">\</span>
&gt;  -s <span class="s1">&#39;from itertools import repeat&#39;</span> <span class="se">\</span>
&gt;  <span class="s1">&#39;for x in repeat(None, 1000000): pass&#39;</span>

100 loops, best of 3: 16.8 msec per loop</pre></div>

<p>So while pursuing an impractical goal,
I did get to learn a useful new <tt class="docutils literal">itertools</tt> trick
that will probably come in handy someday.
And I can always use <tt class="docutils literal">repeat()</tt> for iteration, too,
in case I wind up on an embedded device where every byte is precious!</p>
