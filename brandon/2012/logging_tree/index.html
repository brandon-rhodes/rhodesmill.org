<p>It is frustrating that Python's <tt class="docutils literal">logging</tt> module
cannot display the tangled tree of configured loggers
that often result from combining your own application code
with several libraries and frameworks.
So I have released a new Python package named
<a class="reference external" href="http://pypi.python.org/pypi/logging_tree">logging_tree</a>,
which I announced last month during the
<a class="reference external" href="https://us.pycon.org/2012/">PyCon 2012</a>
<a class="reference external" href="http://pyvideo.org/video/721/sunday-afternoon-lightning-talks-90-minutes">closing lightning talks</a>.
My package displays the current <tt class="docutils literal">logging</tt> tree to help debugging,
and its output looks something like this:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="o">&lt;--</span><span class="s">&quot;&quot;</span>
   Level WARNING
   Handler Stream <span class="o">&lt;</span>open file <span class="s">&#39;&lt;stderr&gt;&#39;</span><span class="p">,</span> mode <span class="s">&#39;w&#39;</span> at <span class="kc">...</span><span class="o">&gt;</span>
   <span class="o">|</span>
   o<span class="o">&lt;--</span><span class="p">[</span>cherrypy<span class="p">]</span>
       <span class="o">|</span>
       o<span class="o">&lt;--</span><span class="s">&quot;cherrypy.access&quot;</span>
       <span class="o">|</span>   Level INFO
       <span class="o">|</span>   Handler Stream <span class="o">&lt;</span>open file <span class="s">&#39;&lt;stdout&gt;&#39;</span><span class="p">,</span> mode <span class="s">&#39;w&#39;</span> <span class="kc">...</span><span class="o">&gt;</span>
       <span class="o">|</span>
       o<span class="o">&lt;--</span><span class="s">&quot;cherrypy.error&quot;</span>
           Level INFO
           Handler Stream <span class="o">&lt;</span>open file <span class="s">&#39;&lt;stderr&gt;&#39;</span><span class="p">,</span> mode <span class="s">&#39;w&#39;</span> <span class="kc">...</span><span class="o">&gt;</span></pre></div>

<p>The configuration shown by this tree, it turns out, causes a bug.
This diagram helped me fix a real-life application
for Atlanta startup <a class="reference external" href="http://roverapps.com/">Rover Apps</a>,
who generously let me open-source <tt class="docutils literal">logging_tree</tt>
after I wrote the first version while helping them fix this bug.</p>
<p>In this post I am going to reproduce the problem
using a simple 10-line CherryPy application,
and then show how I used this <tt class="docutils literal">logging_tree</tt> diagram
to craft a solution.
But, first, you need to know three things
about the Python <tt class="docutils literal">logging</tt> module —
and I would like to thank Marius Gedminas for his
<a class="reference external" href="http://mg.pov.lt/blog/logging-levels">recent post about logging levels</a>
that helped me correct something I had misunderstood.</p>
<!-- more -->
<ul class="simple">
<li>When you call a logger's <tt class="docutils literal">log()</tt> method,
or an equivalent helper like <tt class="docutils literal">error()</tt> or <tt class="docutils literal">debug()</tt>,
your message has only one opportunity to be discarded:
it is compared against that logger's <tt class="docutils literal">level</tt> attribute
and thrown away if it is not at least that important.
But if it passes this one test,
then the message will be submitted not only
to the logger's own handlers,
but also to the handlers on all of the logger's parents —
so a message accepted by logger <tt class="docutils literal">'a.b.c'</tt>
will also be submitted to <tt class="docutils literal">'a.b'</tt>, <tt class="docutils literal">'a'</tt>,
and the root logger <tt class="docutils literal">''</tt> (whose name is the empty string).
The <tt class="docutils literal">level</tt> attribute of a parent logger <em>is completely ignored</em> —
it applies only to messages submitted directly to that logger!</li>
<li>Once a message passes this test against <tt class="docutils literal">logger.level</tt>
and is accepted,
the only thing that can stop it from being submitted
to the handlers of every parent logger
is for it to encounter a false <tt class="docutils literal">propagate</tt> attribute along the way.
After a message is submitted to a logger's handlers,
the logger's <tt class="docutils literal">propagate</tt> attribute is consulted
to see whether the message should jump to the parent logger.
The first false <tt class="docutils literal">propagate</tt> encountered on the way up the tree
kills the message, and no further propagation takes place.</li>
<li>Confusingly, each handler can also choose
to do its own individual filtering by a <tt class="docutils literal">level</tt>
to decide which messages get output by that handler.
Handlers can be configured with complex filters
to determine which messages they are willing to output,
and can even hand messages off to further handlers.</li>
</ul>
<p>Some libraries also define custom filters and handlers.
While <tt class="docutils literal">logging_tree</tt> will at least print their names,
it probably will not know anything else about them,
so you will have to read their source code
to learn more about how they work and behave.</p>
<div class="section" id="the-problem">
<h2>The problem</h2>
<p>We wanted to add some logging to our
<a class="reference external" href="http://cherrypy.org/">CherryPy</a> application,
so — as a simple first step — we grabbed the root logger <tt class="docutils literal">''</tt>
and tried writing a message:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="kn">import</span> <span class="nn">cherrypy</span>
<span class="kn">import</span> <span class="nn">logging</span>

<span class="n">log</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">logging</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">getLogger</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s">&#39;&#39;</span><span class="p">)</span>

<span class="k">class</span> <span class="nc">HelloWorld</span><span class="p">:</span>
    <span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">index</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="bp">self</span><span class="p">):</span>
        <span class="n">log</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">error</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s">&#39;Test message&#39;</span><span class="p">)</span>
        <span class="k">return</span> <span class="s">&#39;Hello world!&#39;</span>
    <span class="n">index</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">exposed</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="bp">True</span>

<span class="k">if</span> <span class="n">__name__</span> <span class="o">==</span> <span class="s">&#39;__main__&#39;</span><span class="p">:</span>
    <span class="n">cherrypy</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">quickstart</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">HelloWorld</span><span class="p">())</span></pre></div>

<p>The result was disappointing.
The site displayed <tt class="docutils literal">Hello</tt> <tt class="docutils literal">world!</tt> in the browser
and produced a standard Apache log message,
but our own log message was nowhere to be seen.
I&nbsp;knew enough about <tt class="docutils literal">logging</tt> to know that
a root handler was necessary if I wanted output,
so I tried adding one:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="o">...</span>
<span class="k">if</span> <span class="n">__name__</span> <span class="o">==</span> <span class="s">&#39;__main__&#39;</span><span class="p">:</span>
    <span class="n">log</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">addHandler</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">logging</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">StreamHandler</span><span class="p">())</span>
    <span class="n">cherrypy</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">quickstart</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">HelloWorld</span><span class="p">())</span></pre></div>

<p>The result was rather bizarre.
While our <tt class="docutils literal">Test</tt> <tt class="docutils literal">message</tt> appeared in the output,
the server now produced <em>two</em> copies of every CherryPy log message.</p>
<p>It was at this point that,
tired of trying to guess how the logging tree looked
by searching our entire code base
for calls to the <tt class="docutils literal">logging</tt> package —
and searching the code of our third-party libraries, like CherryPy —
I instead wrote the first version of <tt class="docutils literal">logging_tree()</tt>
so that I could really see what was going on.
You can install it quite simply,
and it supports any version of Python from 2.3 through&nbsp;3.2:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre>pip install logging_tree</pre></div>

<p>Invoking it from your application can be as simple as:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="kn">import</span> <span class="nn">logging_tree</span>
<span class="n">logging_tree</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">printout</span><span class="p">()</span></pre></div>

<p>These two lines, added to my <tt class="docutils literal">index()</tt> method,
printed the entire logger configuration to my terminal
the next time I reloaded the page.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="interpreting-a-tree">
<h2>Interpreting a tree</h2>
<p>This CherryPy application actually produces
a more complicated logging situation than in the simplified tree
used for illustration at the top of this post.
Here is what <tt class="docutils literal">logging_tree</tt> really prints out —
in a few places I have used ellipses to keep lines
within the margins of my blog,
but this time no lines are omitted:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="o">&lt;--</span><span class="s">&quot;&quot;</span>

           <span class="o">|</span>
           o<span class="o">&lt;--</span><span class="s">&quot;cherrypy.error.166457196&quot;</span>

<p>Loggers that have been created through actual calls to <tt class="docutils literal">getLogger()</tt>
are displayed with their names in double quotes.
When a logger only exists by implication,
but has never actually been named in a <tt class="docutils literal">getLogger()</tt> call —
like the <tt class="docutils literal">[cherrypy]</tt> node —
then its name is shown in square brackets.</p>
<p>Each logger displays its own <tt class="docutils literal">Level</tt> that, as discussed above,
is only consulted when a message is submitted directly to that logger
using one of its methods like <tt class="docutils literal">log()</tt> or <tt class="docutils literal">error()</tt>.</p>
<p>Propagation is turned on for all of these loggers,
as shown by the <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">&lt;--</span></tt> arrows that connect each logger to its parent.</p>
<p>You can see that this tree includes both built-in handlers
and also some custom ones defined in the CherryPy framework.
The <tt class="docutils literal">logging_tree</tt> package tries to introspect the built-in handlers
to give you more information about them —
here, it displays the particular output files
to which the stream handlers will be printing —
but for the CherryPy loggers it has no choice
but to simply print their <tt class="docutils literal">repr()</tt>
and hope that you can make sense of them.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="solving-the-problem">
<h2>Solving the problem</h2>
<p>Thanks to this diagram, the problem is now clear:
because propagation is turned on,
CherryPy logging messages get printed by their own handlers
and <em>also</em> by the new handler we have installed at the root.
You can see this by imagining a new <tt class="docutils literal">cherrypy.access</tt> error message
and following the propagation arrows that will take it from its
logger-of-origin up to the root, where our own handler is installed.</p>
<p>We can see, in fact, that CherryPy creates several loggers
to receive its Apache-style logging messages,
and goes ahead and suits those loggers up with handlers
that write the messages to the correct files.
Since I ran this application in debug mode from the command line,
these handlers are directed at <tt class="docutils literal">&lt;stdout&gt;</tt>
instead of actual log files.</p>
<p>The solution to my problem was to simply turn off propagation,
since CherryPy's handlers were already taking care of its messages:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="n">logging</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">getLogger</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s">&#39;cherrypy&#39;</span><span class="p">)</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">propagate</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="bp">False</span></pre></div>

<p>The <tt class="docutils literal">logging_tree</tt> package makes it very clear
when propagation has been turned off,
both by removing the <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">&lt;--</span></tt> arrow from next to the logger's name,
and also with a <tt class="docutils literal">Propagate</tt> <tt class="docutils literal">OFF</tt> message.
So this is how the tree looked following the fix:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="o">&lt;--</span><span class="s">&quot;&quot;</span>
   Level WARNING
   Handler Stream <span class="o">&lt;</span>open file <span class="s">&#39;&lt;stderr&gt;&#39;</span><span class="p">,</span> mode <span class="s">&#39;w&#39;</span> at <span class="kc">...</span><span class="o">&gt;</span>
   <span class="o">|</span>
   o   <span class="s">&quot;cherrypy&quot;</span>
       Propagate OFF
       <span class="o">|</span>
       <span class="kc">...</span></pre></div>

<p>I hope that <tt class="docutils literal">logging_tree</tt> proves useful
for many more Python programmers
as we all wrestle with logging misbehavior!
The package is available both
<a class="reference external" href="http://pypi.python.org/pypi/logging_tree">on the Python Package Index</a>
and is also available as a
<a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/brandon-rhodes/logging_tree">project on GitHub</a>
if you want to contribute.</p>
