<p>By this time tomorrow I will doubtless be wearing swimming trunks —
in northern Ohio — <em>in winter</em> —
while listening to people rave about Java and C# and Ruby
and wondering what I have gotten myself into.
I&nbsp;will be at <a class="reference external" href="http://codemash.org/">CodeMash</a>,
a conference that was started by developers
who wanted an event that focused solely on the programmer
while including a wide range of languages and technologies.</p>

<p>It was lucky that I signed up
the moment that CodeMash 2012 registration opened back in October,
because the 1,200 conference tickets
sold out in only <strong>20 minutes</strong> —
no event in the Python community
had prepared me for that kind of demand!</p>
<p>I&nbsp;learned about CodeMash conference from its co-founder
<a class="reference external" href="http://brianhprince.com/">Brian Prince</a>
when we were fellow speakers at <a class="reference external" href="http://pyohio.org/">PyOhio</a> last July.
So why did a Python programmer like me decide to attend?</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Even though the technologies that Brian chooses
are different from mine,
he is clearly animated by the same passion
for combining good code with good community.
If his co-founders are at all like him,
then I knew that a great event was in the works.</li>
<li>I want to learn another conference's culture.
For example, I was stunned to see strong suggestions
on the CodeMash mailing list
that attendees should <em>not</em> carry laptops —
instead, they recommend pencil, paper,
and something they call
<a class="reference external" href="http://www.dachisgroup.com/2011/12/the-sketchnote-revolution/">Sketchnotes</a>.
Since good teachers have a reflex
that makes them try to bring the whole audience along with them
as they make a point,
we could actually be slowing up PyCon speakers
when half the audience is face-down typing
and clearly a half step behind what is being said.</li>
</ul>

<ul class="simple">
<li>I could predict that moving to
<a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bluffton,_Ohio">Bluffton, Ohio</a>,
as winter descended
would leave me with very few opportunities
to meet other developers.
After several weeks of being the only programmer I know,
a&nbsp;large regional conference
will let me bask in the company
of other people who understand what I do for a living.</li>
<li>It is too easy to judge other languages
by what I think are drawbacks in their design,
or by the poor code that most programmers produce
whatever their language.
I&nbsp;want see what excites the real experts
who solve interesting problems using Java, Ruby, and C# —
people who use those languages to the hilt, and do a great job of&nbsp;it.</li>
<li>Being evangelized by smart people is interesting and humbling,
if you let down your guard and really listen.
And hearing Ruby and C# people explain the glories of their languages
will remind me of how I must sound
when I hold forth on the advantages of Python,
or <a class="reference external" href="http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/">Emacs</a>,
or <a class="reference external" href="http://www.vibramfivefingers.com/">Vibram Fivefingers</a>.</li>
</ul>

<ul class="simple">
<li>Brian wants to make CodeMash more popular for Python programmers —
and a few luminaries like Bruce Eckel, Mike Pirnat, and Mark Ramm
are already on the schedule this year.
Next year I might offer to speak.
But first I wanted to show up and just listen,
figure out the vibe of the conference,
and learn more about what is happening
outside of the Python community.</li>
<li>Finally, it does sound like great fun:
eating, drinking, and being merry
at an <a class="reference external" href="http://www.kalahariresorts.com/oh/">indoor water park resort</a>
in the middle of an Ohio winter.
Kalahari, here I come!</li>
