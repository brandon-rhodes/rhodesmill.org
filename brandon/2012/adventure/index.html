<p>I have just released
<a class="reference external" href="http://pypi.python.org/pypi/adventure/1.2/">adventure&nbsp;1.2</a>
on the Python Package Index,
an update of my Python&nbsp;3 port
of the original Colossal Cave Adventure game
that I announced more than a year ago during the final round of
<a class="reference external" href="http://pyvideo.org/video/357/pycon-2011--sunday-afternoon-lightning-talks">PyCon 2011 lightning talks</a>.</p>
<a class="reference external image-reference" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/brandonrhodes/6115627693/"><img alt="http://rhodesmill.org/brandon/2012/adventure-heathkit-h19.jpg" src="http://rhodesmill.org/brandon/2012/adventure-heathkit-h19.jpg" /></a>
<p>Written in the late 1970s,
“Adventure” was the first game
to offer players a virtual world to explore at their own pace,
driven by their own curiosity.
The player directs the game with simple one- and two-word commands
like <tt class="docutils literal">ENTER</tt> <tt class="docutils literal">BUILDING</tt> and <tt class="docutils literal">GET</tt> <tt class="docutils literal">LAMP</tt>,
together with the cardinal directions —
which can, mercifully, be typed as abbreviations
(<tt class="docutils literal">N</tt>, <tt class="docutils literal">NE</tt>, <tt class="docutils literal">E</tt>, <tt class="docutils literal">SE</tt>, and so forth,
with <tt class="docutils literal">U</tt> and <tt class="docutils literal">D</tt> for up and down).
Based on a real-life section
of the Flint-Mammoth cave system in Kentucky
that the original author helped map,
“Adventure” invites you to start collecting treasures from the cave
in a quest that eventually involves danger, magic,
and even encounters with a few computer-controlled characters,
who rustle in the darkness beyond the light of your lamp
before finally pouncing.</p>
<p>Keep reading if you want to learn
about several discoveries that I made
while porting “Adventure” to Python!
If you want to know more about the history of the original game itself,
I recommend Dennis G.&nbsp;Jerz's admirably thorough paper
“<a class="reference external" href="http://www.digitalhumanities.org/dhq/vol/001/2/000009/000009.html">Somewhere Nearby is Colossal Cave: Examining Will Crowther's Original ‘Adventure’ in Code and in Kentucky</a>”
from the Summer 2007 issue of the Digital Humanities Quarterly.</p>
<div class="section" id="playing-at-the-prompt">
<h2>Playing at the prompt</h2>
<p>I was inspired to write the <tt class="docutils literal">adventure</tt> package
when I realized that typing a name at the Python prompt
could invoke an action if the object it referenced
did something useful inside of its <tt class="docutils literal">__repr__()</tt> method.</p>
<!-- more -->
<p>Recall that a language like Ruby invokes a function
if you merely mention the function's name:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="n">jump</span>    <span class="c1"># call the &quot;jump&quot; function in Ruby</span></pre></div>

<p>I imagine that this would make it easy
to implement a game like Adventure at the Ruby prompt.
Typing the name of a command like <tt class="docutils literal">jump</tt> or <tt class="docutils literal">n</tt> or <tt class="docutils literal">sw</tt>
would simply invoke it, just like at the prompt of the original game.</p>
<p>In Python, however —
as in higher math more generally,
whose scruples Python tends to honor more faithfully
than do other popular languages —
<tt class="docutils literal">jump</tt> is merely a name,
and its mention merely retrieves a reference to the function it names.
To actually invoke the function you need to follow the name
with a pair of parentheses:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="n">jump</span><span class="p">()</span>    <span class="c"># call the &quot;jump&quot; function in Python</span></pre></div>

<p>For more about this distinction,
see the discussion of songs and names-of-songs
between Alice and the Red Knight in
<a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Through_the_Looking-Glass,_and_What_Alice_Found_There/Chapter_VIII">Chapter VIII</a>
of <em>Through the Looking Glass</em>
— remember that Lewis Carroll was a logician in his day job! —
or, if you find his writing too tedious,
start at the Wikipedia article on the
<a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Use%E2%80%93mention_distinction">use-mention distinction</a>.
And tell any analytic philosophers you know
that Python is your favorite programming language.</p>
<p>So the following line of Python code by definition does nothing,
except, perhaps — depending on which implementation of Python you use —
innocently incrementing and then decrementing
the <tt class="docutils literal">jump</tt> object's reference count:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="n">jump</span>    <span class="c"># fetches then discards a reference</span></pre></div>

<p>But things are quite different if,
instead of appearing in a script on a line by itself,
the bare name is typed at the interactive Python prompt.
The third action taken by the prompt's read-eval-print loop —
the “print” action —
invokes the object's <tt class="docutils literal">__repr__()</tt> method.
A&nbsp;normal function simply describes itself:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="o">&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> <span class="nb">max</span>
<span class="o">&lt;</span><span class="n">built</span><span class="o">-</span><span class="ow">in</span> <span class="n">function</span> <span class="nb">max</span><span class="o">&gt;</span></pre></div>

<p>But if we write a class of our own,
we can do arbitrarily complex work when <tt class="docutils literal">__repr__()</tt> is called!</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="o">&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> <span class="k">class</span> <span class="nc">C</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nb">object</span><span class="p">):</span>
<span class="o">...</span>     <span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">__repr__</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="bp">self</span><span class="p">):</span>
<span class="o">...</span>         <span class="k">print</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s">&#39;[advancing the game state]&#39;</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="o">...</span>         <span class="k">return</span> <span class="s">&#39;There is a shiny brass lamp nearby.&#39;</span>
<span class="o">...</span>
<span class="o">&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> <span class="n">jump</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">C</span><span class="p">()</span></pre></div>

<p>We now have an object that, when simply named,
causes something to happen and then returns a message
that Python displays to show us the result.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="o">&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> <span class="n">jump</span>
<span class="p">[</span><span class="n">advancing</span> <span class="n">the</span> <span class="n">game</span> <span class="n">state</span><span class="p">]</span>
<span class="n">There</span> <span class="ow">is</span> <span class="n">a</span> <span class="n">shiny</span> <span class="n">brass</span> <span class="n">lamp</span> <span class="n">nearby</span><span class="o">.</span></pre></div>

<p>And this is what the <tt class="docutils literal">adventure</tt> package does, in spades.
When you invoke its <tt class="docutils literal">play()</tt> function at the Python prompt,
it uses the
<a class="reference external" href="http://docs.python.org/library/inspect.html">inspect</a>
Standard Library module
to reach into the scope of your Python prompt
and define every “Adventure” noun and verb as a symbol
whose <tt class="docutils literal">__repr__()</tt> is sitting ready to be triggered.</p>
<p>The word objects are also supplied with other methods
like <tt class="docutils literal">__call__()</tt> and <tt class="docutils literal">__getattr__()</tt>
so that words can be composed to form more complex commands,
like <tt class="docutils literal">get(lamp)</tt> or <tt class="docutils literal">get.lamp</tt> —
see
<a class="reference external" href="https://bitbucket.org/brandon/adventure/src/86507c6fe2b9/adventure/prompt.py">prompt.py</a>
if you want to read all of the details.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="de-morgan-and-old-fortran">
<h2>De&nbsp;Morgan and old FORTRAN</h2>
<p>The original FORTRAN language
in which “Adventure” is written
does not support “structured programming” —
you cannot combine several statements into a single block of code
under the control of an <tt class="docutils literal">IF</tt> statement.
Instead, <tt class="docutils literal">IF</tt> can only govern
the single statement that follows it.
Several statements can be skipped by an <tt class="docutils literal">IF</tt>
only if it does a <tt class="docutils literal">GOTO</tt> to a line number that follows them.
Here, for example, is an excerpt from <tt class="docutils literal">advent.for</tt>
in which an <tt class="docutils literal">IF</tt> clause controls two statements,
with normal execution continuing at line <tt class="docutils literal">2630</tt>:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="mi">2610</span>    <span class="k">IF</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nv">WD1</span><span class="ow">.NE.</span><span class="s1">&#39;WEST&#39;</span><span class="p">)</span><span class="k">GOTO </span><span class="mi">2630</span>
        <span class="nv">IWEST</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="nv">IWEST</span><span class="o">+</span><span class="mi">1</span>
        <span class="k">IF</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nv">IWEST</span><span class="ow">.EQ.</span><span class="mi">10</span><span class="p">)</span><span class="k">CALL </span><span class="nv">RSPEAK</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="mi">17</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="mi">2630</span></pre></div>

<p>When I translated this code into Python,
the line number and <tt class="docutils literal">GOTO</tt> disappeared
in favor of simply indenting the lines that run conditionally:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="k">if</span> <span class="n">word1</span> <span class="o">==</span> <span class="s">&#39;west&#39;</span><span class="p">:</span>
    <span class="n">full_wests</span> <span class="o">+=</span> <span class="mi">1</span>
    <span class="k">if</span> <span class="n">full_wests</span> <span class="o">==</span> <span class="mi">10</span><span class="p">:</span>
        <span class="n">write_message</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="mi">17</span><span class="p">)</span></pre></div>

<p>You will note that my outer Python <tt class="docutils literal">if</tt> statement
tests a condition that is, in fact, the complete <em>opposite</em>
of its equivalent in FORTRAN:
the original code wants the word to not-equal <tt class="docutils literal">'WEST'</tt>
whereas, in my rewrite, I test whether they are equal instead.
The reason is plain enough:
while my modern Python code gets to directly test
whether to <em>execute</em> the block of code,
the original FORTRAN has to think backwards
and test whether to <em>skip</em> the statements that follow.</p>
<p>(Note that the second <tt class="docutils literal">IF</tt> statement
controls only a single line of code,
and therefore is written “forwards” even in FORTRAN.)</p>
<p>Flipping a simple <tt class="docutils literal">.NE.</tt> so that it becomes <tt class="docutils literal">==</tt> is simple enough.
But what happens when I need to
<a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Third_Doctor#.22Reverse_the_polarity.22">reverse the polarity</a>
of a more complex expression?</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre>        <span class="k">IF</span><span class="p">((</span><span class="nv">WD1</span><span class="ow">.NE.</span><span class="s1">&#39;WATER&#39;</span><span class="ow">.AND.</span><span class="nv">WD1</span><span class="ow">.NE.</span><span class="s1">&#39;OIL&#39;</span><span class="p">)</span>
        <span class="mi">1</span>      <span class="ow">.OR.</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nv">WD2</span><span class="ow">.NE.</span><span class="s1">&#39;PLANT&#39;</span><span class="ow">.AND.</span><span class="nv">WD2</span><span class="ow">.NE.</span><span class="s1">&#39;DOOR&#39;</span><span class="p">))</span><span class="k">GOTO </span><span class="mi">2610</span>
        <span class="k">IF</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nv">AT</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nv">VOCAB</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nv">WD2</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">)))</span><span class="nv">WD2</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="s1">&#39;POUR&#39;</span>
<span class="mi">2610</span></pre></div>

<p>I was delighted!
Here — <em>finally</em> — was a use for De Morgan's laws,
a mere seventeen years after I learned them in computer science class.</p>
<p><a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/De_Morgan's_laws">De Morgan's laws</a>
state, basically,
that instead of simply slapping <tt class="docutils literal">not</tt> in front of a large expression —
making your code even harder to read —
you can dive into the big expression and change <tt class="docutils literal">and</tt> to <tt class="docutils literal">or</tt>,
<tt class="docutils literal">or</tt> to <tt class="docutils literal">and</tt>,
and then reverse the meaning of each equality.
The result will mean precisely the opposite,
the <tt class="docutils literal">not</tt>, of the original big expression.
You do have to be careful with parentheses
since <tt class="docutils literal">and</tt> and <tt class="docutils literal">or</tt> have different precedence
in most programming languages,
but De Morgan let me convert the FORTRAN above
into roughly this Python translation:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="k">if</span> <span class="p">((</span><span class="n">word1</span> <span class="o">==</span> <span class="s">&#39;water&#39;</span> <span class="ow">or</span> <span class="n">word1</span> <span class="o">==</span> <span class="s">&#39;oil&#39;</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="ow">and</span>
    <span class="p">(</span><span class="n">word2</span> <span class="o">==</span> <span class="s">&#39;plant&#39;</span> <span class="ow">or</span> <span class="n">word2</span> <span class="o">==</span> <span class="s">&#39;door&#39;</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="ow">and</span>
    <span class="bp">self</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">is_here</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="bp">self</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">referent</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">word2</span><span class="p">))):</span>
    <span class="o">...</span></pre></div>

<p>And the result works great.
In general, much of the work
of translating “Adventure” to Python
involved taking FORTRAN code that said one thing
and making it say more or less exactly the opposite,
so that I could replace <tt class="docutils literal">GOTO</tt> statements
with more modern — and more readable — control flow.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="testing-randomness-is-tricky">
<h2>Testing randomness is tricky</h2>
<p>The main tests for the game are two large walkthroughs.
You can find them in the package's <tt class="docutils literal">tests</tt> directory.
Since the game is playable at the Python prompt,
each walkthrough is simply a long docfile
that starts the game and plays to completion.
I pass them to a Standard Library
<a class="reference external" href="http://docs.python.org/library/doctest.html#doctest.DocFileSuite">DocFileSuite</a>
and away they go.</p>
<p>As soon as I started implementing game elements
that involved chance, my tests started breaking,
because the series of numbers from the
<a class="reference external" href="http://docs.python.org/library/random.html">random</a>
Standard Library module is different every time you run Python.
This has a well-known fix:
at the beginning of each test
I set the <tt class="docutils literal">random</tt> generator's seed value,
making the sequence of pseudo-random numbers
unfold in the same order every time.
In case anyone runs my tests in parallel,
I even abandoned the global random number generator
and gave each instance of my <tt class="docutils literal">Game</tt> class
its own <tt class="docutils literal">Random()</tt> object,
so that two games going at once
will not interfere with each other's stream of random numbers.
So each walkthrough starts with something like:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="o">&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> <span class="k">import</span> <span class="nx">adventure</span>
<span class="o">&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> <span class="nx">adventure.play</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">seed</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="mi">2</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="nx">WELCOME</span> <span class="k">TO</span> <span class="nx">ADVENTURE</span><span class="o">!!</span>  <span class="nx">WOULD</span> <span class="nx">YOU</span> <span class="nx">LIKE</span> <span class="nx">INSTRUCTIONS</span><span class="o">?</span>
<span class="o">&lt;</span><span class="nx">BLANKLINE</span><span class="o">&gt;</span>
<span class="o">&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> <span class="nx">no</span></pre></div>

<p>After all of that caution, I felt betrayed and dismayed
when the tests <em>still</em> wound up being random,
giving different output every time they were run!</p>
<p>It took me quite a long time to realize
that my problem was this scrap of code:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="n">locations</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="p">{</span>
    <span class="c"># every Room() object reachable from here</span>
    <span class="p">}</span>
<span class="n">next_room</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="bp">self</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">random</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">choice</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">locations</span><span class="p">)</span></pre></div>

<p>Why is this code a problem?
Because of four different facts
that, when combined together, make trouble:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>To choose an item from a set <tt class="docutils literal">s</tt>,
<tt class="docutils literal">choice()</tt> selects an integer <tt class="docutils literal">0</tt> <tt class="docutils literal">≤</tt> <tt class="docutils literal">n</tt> <tt class="docutils literal">&lt;</tt> <tt class="docutils literal">len(s)</tt>
and iterates over <tt class="docutils literal">n</tt> items to find item number <tt class="docutils literal">n</tt>.</li>
<li>Sets, by definition, they have no inherent ordering.</li>
<li>When faced with quite generic objects like my <tt class="docutils literal">Room</tt> instances,
Python sets must hash and store them by their memory addresses.</li>
<li>Finally, Python object memory address are not stable
from one run of the interpreter to the next,
even if you are running exactly the same sequence of operations!</li>
</ul>
<p>So the random number generator
would indeed return a stable value like, say,&nbsp;3,
but iterating across <tt class="docutils literal">locations</tt> would yield a different
“object&nbsp;3” each time I ran my tests.</p>
<p>The worse part was that these random room decisions were hidden —
their consequences were not immediately visible to the player —
so the walkthrough would not fail until much later,
when the execution of the above code snippet was far in the past.
I&nbsp;kept staring at the code at the point of failure,
not at all suspecting that the random number generator
was being knocked off course invisibly
a hundred lines earlier in the walkthrough!</p>
<p>The solution was simple: to sort the rooms into a list
on some criteria <em>other</em> than their memory address
before letting <tt class="docutils literal">choice()</tt> get to work on them.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="a-grand-adventure-at-1200-baud">
<h2>A grand adventure, at 1200 baud</h2>
<p>My final discovery was made quite by accident.
Now that “Adventure” could be played at the Python prompt,
I also added a real console prompt that requires no syntactic magic.
Simply invoke the <tt class="docutils literal">adventure</tt> package and start typing:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="err">$</span> <span class="n">python</span> <span class="o">-</span><span class="n">m</span> <span class="n">adventure</span>
<span class="n">WELCOME</span> <span class="n">TO</span> <span class="n">ADVENTURE</span><span class="o">!!</span>  <span class="n">WOULD</span> <span class="n">YOU</span> <span class="n">LIKE</span> <span class="n">INSTRUCTIONS</span><span class="o">?</span>

<span class="o">&gt;</span> <span class="n">no</span>
<span class="n">YOU</span> <span class="n">ARE</span> <span class="n">STANDING</span> <span class="n">AT</span> <span class="n">THE</span> <span class="n">END</span> <span class="n">OF</span> <span class="n">A</span> <span class="n">ROAD</span> <span class="n">BEFORE</span> <span class="n">A</span> <span class="n">SMALL</span> <span class="n">BRICK</span> <span class="n">BUILDING</span><span class="p">.</span>

<span class="n">DOWN</span> <span class="n">A</span> <span class="n">GULLY</span><span class="p">.</span>

<span class="o">&gt;</span> <span class="n">enter</span> <span class="n">building</span></pre></div>

<p>Just for fun, I replaced the <tt class="docutils literal">print</tt> statement with a delayed loop
that prints characters at the speed of a 1200 baud modem
like the modem over which I myself first played the “Adventure” game.
And after a few minutes of playing
I was suddenly brought up short
by the fact that the game seemed, somehow, to be more fun
when the text was presented slowly.</p>
<p>What was going on?</p>
<p>I paid close attention to the game experience,
and remembered that the human eye scans — and does not merely read —
a block of text that appears on the screen all at once.
Even if you intend to read a paragraph as narrative,
your eyes will jealously dart forward
to get a glimpse of what happens next;
your mind wants to initially take in the paragraph as <em>gestalt</em>.
Recall how hard it is to pay attention in a novel,
if farther down the page you see emphatic lettering
that signals that something terrible is about to happen!</p>
<p>Now consider the following event
from early in the “Adventure” game:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="o">&gt;</span> <span class="n">n</span>
<span class="n">YOU</span> <span class="n">ARE</span> <span class="n">IN</span> <span class="n">THE</span> <span class="n">HALL</span> <span class="n">OF</span> <span class="n">THE</span> <span class="n">MOUNTAIN</span> <span class="n">KING</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">WITH</span> <span class="n">PASSAGES</span> <span class="n">OFF</span> <span class="n">IN</span> <span class="n">ALL</span>
<span class="n">DIRECTIONS</span><span class="p">.</span>

<span class="n">A</span> <span class="n">HUGE</span> <span class="n">GREEN</span> <span class="n">FIERCE</span> <span class="n">SNAKE</span> <span class="n">BARS</span> <span class="n">THE</span> <span class="n">WAY</span><span class="o">!</span></pre></div>

<p>When this text is presented all at once,
my eye jumps immediately to the exclamation point,
finds out about the snake,
and only then — almost as an afterthought — gets around to reading
about my location.
It only makes things worse that the news about the snake
will have appeared nearly on top
of where my prompt was sitting
as I watched myself type the <tt class="docutils literal">s</tt> command.</p>
<p>It would normally be exciting to reach a location
with as storied a name as “the Hall of the Mountain King.”
Both Ibsen and Tolkien might leap to mind.
And after the safety of exploring narrow corridors,
a shiver goes down my spine to realize that my lamp
no longer finds solid walls close at hand,
but that passages recede into darkness in “all directions.”
All of this can be ruined if I read first about the snake
and hardly pause to read the room description
because I am thinking about my safety instead.</p>
<p>At 1200 baud my experience of the text is completely different.
It does scroll by at a speed faster than I can read —
I am not bored waiting for more text to appear as I am at 300 baud —
but I am forced, as were all early “Adventure” players,
to learn something about my location
before I am then startled by the presence of danger.
And the danger feels all the more acute
if I know already that this is the Hall of the Mountain King which,
offering passages in all directions,
lacks even a single wall that I could turn my back against.</p>
<p>I am happy to have solved the technical puzzle
of how “Adventure” might be played at the Python prompt.
And without the challenge
it would not have occurred to me to sit down over Christmas 2010
and to start porting the game in the first place.
But having played the game both ways —
with descriptions appearing instantly at the Python prompt,
versus being printed slowly by a dedicated game prompt —
I must say that I much prefer the latter.</p>
<p>And so I suggest,
if you are playing “Adventure” for the first time,
that you invoke it with <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">-m</span></tt>
and simply ignore the fun that I had as I conquered
the limitations of the Python prompt.
You and the game deserve it!</p>
