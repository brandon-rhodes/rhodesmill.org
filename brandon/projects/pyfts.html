 <title>PyFTS Python interface to OpenFTS</title>

<h1>PyFTS</h1>

<blockquote>
<i>A Python interface to the OpenFTS full-text search engine</i>
<p>
<b>Status:</b> the author currently uses the example web interface
to search the 241&nbsp;MB of email in his archive,
and can find old emails much faster now.
</blockquote>
<p>
The <a href="http://openfts.sourceforge.net/">OpenFTS</a> project
is developing index types and functions
for the <a href="http://www.postgresql.org/">PostgreSQL</a> database
which provide the ability to conduct efficient full-text searches.
While their work is both important and valuable,
they currently offer native programming interfaces
only to users of the <a href="http://tcl.sourceforge.net/">Tcl</a>
and <a href="http://www.perl.org/">Perl</a> languages.
<p>
This package provides the beginnings of a third progamming interface,
this time for the <a href="http://www.python.org/">Python</a> language.
Though still under development,
this Python interface can already do simple searches
using the same document parsing and lexeme analysis
performed by the other interfaces.
<p>
You will need to acquire PostgreSQL and OpenFTS yourself,
as well as the <a href="http://www.druid.net/pygresql/">PyGreSQL</a> module
which this library uses to communicate with the database.
This package includes:
<ul>
<li>Python extension modules
 which provide access to the low-level OpenFTS routines
 for both document parsing and English word stemming.
<li>A full python package built on top of these modules
 which provides operations for document indexing, searching, and headlining.
<li>An example application
 which will index directories full of documents for you,
 then let you search them either from the command line or a web browser.
</ul>
