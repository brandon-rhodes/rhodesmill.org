Debian Linux does many things quite well, well enough in fact that I
have adopted it as my distribution of choice.

---- Lossy dpkg -l Output ----

One glaring problem is the horrible `dpkg -l' command, whose author
breaks the longstanding Unix tradition of refusing to truncate fields
in order to format an output table.  Proper Unix utilities all make
extra room for large field values so no information is lost.  Programs
that scan tables use whitespace or other separators, rather than fixed
character columns, to avoid getting confused by this.  A good example
is the ls(1) command which expands the file size field for very large
files, rather than either truncate the value or use another format:

-rw-r--r--    1 grendel  users    122185728 Nov  2 09:13 Invader Zim - 101
-rw-r--r--    1 grendel  users    61841408 Nov  1 11:46 Invader Zim - 102a
-rw-r--r--    1 grendel  users    62228480 Nov  1 11:49 Invader Zim - 102b
-rw-r--r--    1 grendel  users    122249216 Nov  2 06:55 Invader Zim - Halloween
-rw-r--r--    1 grendel  users    50552832 Feb  3 16:12 InvaderZim-111a
-rw-r--r--    1 grendel  users    52201472 Feb  3 16:24 InvaderZim-111b

You see?  The date and file name are simply moved rightward when the
file size is too large to fit within the normal eight characters.

Thus we recoil in horror when, for instance, trying to determine which
kernel images are listed in our package database:

$ dpkg -l 'kernel-image*'
Desired=Unknown/Install/Remove/Purge/Hold
| Status=Not/Installed/Config-files/Unpacked/Failed-config/Half-installed
|/ Err?=(none)/Hold/Reinst-required/X=both-problems (Status,Err: uppercase=bad)
||/ Name           Version        Description
+++-==============-==============-============================================
un  kernel-image   <none>         (no description available)
pn  kernel-image-2 <none>         (no description available)
ii  kernel-image-2 2.4.16-1       Linux kernel image for version 2.4.16 on PPr
pn  kernel-image-2 <none>         (no description available)
pn  kernel-image-2 <none>         (no description available)
pn  kernel-image-2 <none>         (no description available)

Because the utility ruthlessly truncates the package names, we cannot
see what kernel versions are listed; and in fact dpkg(8) does not even
provide an *option* allowing wider output!

Fortunately we are saved by the fact that dpkg(8) uses the COLUMNS
variable to determine how much screen width across which to spangle
its output.  This allows us to write a small command of our own which
I call `mypkgs':

<++> mypkgs
COLUMNS=256 dpkg -l \*$1\* | awk 'NR>5 {printf "%s %18s %-s\n",$1,$3,$2}'
<-->

Note that my choice was to automatically place wildcard asterisks
around the search string given, so the command works like so:

$ mypkgs kernel-image
un             <none> kernel-image
pn             <none> kernel-image-2.2.19
ii           2.4.16-1 kernel-image-2.4.16-686
pn             <none> kernel-image-2.4.9-686
pn             <none> kernel-image-2.4.9-686-smp
pn             <none> kernel-image-2.4.9-k6

And we can breathe a collective sigh of relief; full package names are
now visible without having to enter the awkward world of dselect(8).

Why the packages listed are not those listed on the Debian web site
listing of current packages is yet to be determined.
