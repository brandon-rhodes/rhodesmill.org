Emacs has been my editor since the late 1980s.  The following have
been useful through my years of using GNU emacs.

---- Viewing Microsoft Word Documents within Gnus ----

Other researchers often forward Microsoft Word documents as MIME
attachments.  Gnus knows about MIME attachments but upon selecting
them one discovers that saving them to a file is the best it can do in
the way of processing them.  But there is at least one free system,
wvWare, for viewing Word documents under Linux; the challenge was to
arrange for Emacs to call it internally.

The command-line utilities which come with wvWare are poorly written.
Note only do not support standard input and output, but they create
temporary files in the current working directory without even checking
whether they are overwriting any files of your own!  (See the code of
"wvText" for an example.)  So before using them from Emacs it behooves
us to create a "wvTextStdin" command which performs the function of
"wvText" but uses the standard input and output.

After installing wvWare (accomplished under Debian by typing `apt-get
install wv') I placed the following command in my path:

<++> wvTextStdin
#!/bin/zsh
# Allow wvText to read from the standard input.

t=$(basename $(tempfile))
cat "$@" > /tmp/$f.doc
cd /tmp
wvText $f.doc $f.txt
cat $f.txt
rm -f $f.doc $f.txt
<-->

Finally the following lines had to be added to .emacs (well, actually
to .xemacs/init.el) so that clicking on Word attachments would expand
them in-line:

<++>
(defun mm-inline-msword (handle)
  "Return foo bar"
  (let (text)
    (with-temp-buffer
      (mm-insert-part handle)
      (call-process-region (point-min) (point-max) "wvTextStdin" t t nil)
      (setq text (buffer-string)))
    (mm-insert-inline handle text)))

(setq mm-automatic-display
      (append mm-automatic-display
            '("application/msword")))

(setq mm-inlined-types
      (append mm-inlined-types
            '("application/msword" "application/octet-stream")))

(setq mm-inline-media-tests
      (append mm-inline-media-tests
	      '(("application/msword" mm-inline-msword identity))
	      '(("application/octet-stream" mm-inline-msword 
		 (lambda (handle)
		   (let* ((type (mm-handle-type handle))
			  (name-pair (assq 'name type))
			  (name (cdr name-pair)))
		     (if name (equal ".doc" (substring name -4 nil)))
		     ))))))
<-->

The "mm-inline-msword" function, when given a Word attachment, feeds
it to the "wvTextStdin" command we wrote above and places the output
in the article buffer.  Then three "setq" calls add entries for new
MIME types to some internal lists.  The last function is somewhat
complicated because word documents arrive in my email not only typed
as "application/msword", but sometimes as "application/octet-stream"
attachments which can only be identified as Word documents by noting
that their file names end with ".doc".
