<h1>History Documents at Rhodes Mill</h1>

Eventually this page will have several examples of first-hand history,
but for the moment it has only a single document:

<ul>
<li><b><a href="close_calls.html">Close Calls</a></b>
 &mdash; stories of World War II flight training
 from Colonel &ldquo;Chuck&rdquo; Whitehead.
</ul>

For information on the history of the Rhodes Mill itself,
