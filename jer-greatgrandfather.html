<h1 class="wide">GREAT&#8203;GRAND&#8203;FATHER</h1>

<p><i>The life of Newton Marion
Rhodes (1829&ndash;1901)</i></p>

<p>He was named for two
Revolutionary War heroes. In his early twenties he named his
second son for one of them, and at forty named another son
for the other.</p>

<p>When Newton Marion Rhodes was
born in 1829 practical communications and travel went at the
speed of a horse. Railroads went everywhere in the country
in 1901 when he died. Telegraph lines paralleled the
railroads. A private telephone line ran from his mill office
to his home about a mile away. Is there more trauma from
change across my lifetime than across his?</p>

</div>
<p>Newton Marion Rhodes, my
greatgrandfather, materialized in South Alabama. No one
knows of his forebears. (Not precisely; his father, also
Newton Marion, is in the 1830 Census for Butler County. His
mother was Amy.) Vague tradition says the family came from
Virginia or South Carolina&mdash;not unlikely places. His
father died when he was a small child, four years old, say.
We do not have details of how the family made out until he
and his sisters were young adults. Instead of details we
have one vignette.</p>

<p>When he was still a child, he
was trying to plow corn with a mule, but with clumsy,
unsatisfactory results. The mule was tangling his lines and
young Greatgrandfather thought the mule was being
uncooperative. Finally the child was reduced to tears. A
watching neighbor then advised him that the mule knew better
how to plow corn than he did, that he should plow the other
side of the row.</p>

<p>Everyone who had known him
laughed hard when this story was told, and it was told many
times. The notion of comparing his know-how with that of a
mule was preposterous, that a mule knew better was
hilarious.</p>

<p>I am not a mule-man either, but
corn was plowed with a sweep blade mounted on a Georgia
plowstock to clear weeds by cutting them off just under the
surface, and to throw dirt up around the stalks when they
had grown tall and the ears were making. Mules must have
been accustomed to always going down the row with the near
corn always on the same side, the left I believe.</p>

<p>When Greatgrandfather was still
a young man he established a &ldquo;plantation.&rdquo; It
consisted of a large log house, noted on the community map,
and some surrounding land. I do not know if any slave labor
was employed, but it is possible as there are lots of black
people in the area. The farm must have been successful, as
Greatgrandfather was a respected citizen in the community in
his mid-twenties when he became Justice of the Peace for
South Butler County.</p>

<div class="figure">
<a href="http://rhodesmill.org/images/1896-hudson-engine:full.jpg">
<img src="http://rhodesmill.org/images/1896-hudson-engine:320.jpg">
</a>
Greatgrandfather helped raise Jeff Hudson, seen here (second from the left) with his oil can and locomotive in Greenville, Alabama (1896).
</div>
<p>JP Court was held in
Hudson&rsquo;s store, a mile from the log house and half a
mile from where Rhodes&rsquo; Mill would flourish. One of
Greatgrandfather&rsquo;s sisters married a Hudson. When her
husband died, Greatgrandfather became unofficial father to
her sons, one of whom, Jeff, became an engineer on the
L&amp;N. His picture (dated 1896) with his engine and train
crew stands today in my study. I got to know Jeff&rsquo;s
widow when I was a child. She was a Cook. Her brother, Henry
(H.&nbsp;B.) and his wife Florence are buried close to
Greatgrandfather in Riley Cemetery.</p>

<p>Greatgrandfather held the post
of JP some ten years, at least. I have read the docket for
those years, and there are no entries for about eighteen
months, when he must have been away at the Civil War. Family
tradition says he was taken prisoner early in the war, and
was imprisoned on Ship Island (Fort Massachusetts off Biloxi
and Gulfport) for the duration. The docket suggests a
shorter service, but the imprisonment was real. (The docket
was loaned to me in 1954 by Olive Rhodes Page, Uncle
Jule&rsquo;s daughter. I read parts of it into a tape
recorder, but the tape deuterated, and only fragments of it
can be understood on a copy. I returned the docket to Olive
in the summer of 1955.)</p>

<p>Greatgrandfather was not a
talking Confederate veteran. He regarded the war as a sad
and troublesome time. He did occasionally tell of hunger in
the prison camp. He was often feeling so unwell that he
passed up his share of what was available. For humiliation,
the prisoners were guarded by colored soldiers. There was
enough brutality to make a thoughtful man reticent.</p>

<p>As noted, the plantation or farm
was successful. One account says it once employed
&ldquo;fifty plows.&rdquo; This seems exaggerated.</p><hr>

<p>Greatgrandfather styled himself &ldquo;cabnet
maker&rdquo; (sic) in the 1860 Census, and it reports he had
$12,000 worth of personal property, a considerable amount.
Had he established a cabinet shop, possibly at the future
mill site? Did it include powered machinery? There is no
family tradition that says so, but there is a tradition that
he made furniture as a hobby.</p>

<p>It was after the Civil War,
probably, when the mill was built and some seven thousand
acres of timber acquired. Where did the capital for this
come from? From the earnings of a successful farm or cabinet
shop? Unlikely. Maybe it started with much smaller holdings,
and grew as the operation became successful.</p>

<p>In any event, Rhodes&rsquo;
Mill, as the operation and the community around it became
known, did get established. A large mill pond was dammed up.
It supplied water power for many years, and the pond served
to float big logs to the mill, sometimes from sites several
miles away. The mill pond was also a source of recreation.
Neighbors fished there; people from further away fished and
camped on the commissary grounds.</p>

<p>The commissary yard was favored
by picnicers and campers for years after the mill closed.
Earl McGowan of Chapman wrote me that he swam in the mill
pond as a boy, 1912&ndash;1914 I guess. About 1929 I went
with my father in his 1928 Chevrolet coupe to Butler County.
Because of road work along Highway 31, we took the road to
Luverne from Montgomery, and came to the mill site from the
east in the early evening. There was a full moon. We had
talked of camping out ourselves, but the commissary yard was
full of revelers who had come out for the evening, or maybe
to camp overnight. We drove off the road on the north side
of the road, into the woods, but found no suitable area to
spend the night. After half an hour we drove into Georgiana,
and spent the night with Uncle Newt.</p>

<p>A boarding house in the
community served as an informal hotel for the more affluent.
Milton Smith, president of the L&amp;N Railroad must have
come. Father paddled a boat for him.</p>

<p>A fish trap at a flood gate
would yield fish galore when the gate was opened to lower
the pond for repairs, to pass the spring rains, or for other
reasons. One colored man, George Trawick, made his living
fishing. He was so honored in the community that he was
buried in what was normally white burial grounds, the same
where Greatgrandfather rests today.</p><hr>

<p>The mill and Greatgrandfather are so entwined that
one&rsquo;s story cannot be told without the other.
Greatgrandfather&rsquo;s offspring affected the enterprise,
so they need to be enumerated and identified.</p>

<p>Greatgrandfather married
Elizabeth Stewart, and their firstborn was Robert William,
in 1850, when Greatgrandfather was twenty-one. Robert died
in his mid-twenties, so his impact on the operation was
minimal. There is a touching four-line verse on his
headstone, composed by Greatgrandfather, I am sure. There
were two more sons, Francis Marion (b.&nbsp;1852) and Julius
Wood (b.&nbsp;1854). Their mother died in 1856.</p>

<div class="figure">

<img src="http://rhodesmill.org/images/1897-jtr-house:320.jpg">
</a>
Home of Joseph Turner in Shell, Alabama (1897).
</div>
<p>How Greatgrandfather managed
three small children for the next three years is left to the
imagination. His mother, Amy, still lived; maybe she helped.
(Greatgrandfather wrote a verse for her tombstone in 1868.
Brandon and I could make out only the first line or two.)
Then he married my greatgrandmother, Sarah Turner, in 1859.
Daughter Elizabeth was born in 1860; an &ldquo;infant&rdquo;
daughter died in 1863. Their sons were born after the Civil
War. Twins, Dan and Dave, 1866; my grandfather, Joseph
Turner, 1868; Newton T. (Uncle Newt, whom I knew), 1870; and
daughter, Sarah Della, 1873.</p>

<p>Daughter Elizabeth married Wade
F. Shell in 1880. Uncle Wade and Uncle Marion must have run
the store or commissary. Rhodes Mill became enough of a
community that a post office seemed appropriate. Uncle Wade
filled out and signed the application, and became the first
postmaster. The post office charter, due to a lapse on the
part of a government clerk, named the community Shell,
rather than Rhodes Mill, the popular name of the settlement.
No correction was sought, and a road intersection just up
the hill from the mill and commissary sites is marked Shell
on maps today. The Shell family lived in the area, but it
was that clerk&rsquo;s mistake that put them on the map.</p>

<p>Uncle Wade and Uncle Marion did
not stay in the community. Subsequently they had a store in
Greenville, the county seat of Butler County, some twenty
miles away.</p>

<p>Uncle Marion&rsquo;s first wife,
a Graham, died. His second, called Aunt Callie by my aunts,
was kin to the Beelands, the name of a third partner in the
Greenville store. (We knew a Beeland offspring in Cobb
County some years ago. Beeland&rsquo;s store closed during
our association.)</p>

<p>A son, Grady, emigrated with the
Graham family to Texas, and he was later jailed in a
shooting. No details. Son, Randall, also moved to Texas or
Oklahoma. Son, Stacy, was injured running timber, and
subsequently ran a pool room in Tampa.</p>

<p>Uncle Wade left the partnership
and went to Birmingham after Grandpa moved there (1906). His
wife had died, and he had a daughter, Alva, to care for. He
and Alva boarded with Grandpa in Birmingham until he
remarried.</p> <hr>

<p>Uncle Jule officially ran the grist mill, but he helped
manage the sawmill, too.</p><hr>

<p>The second group of sons, nominally ten years younger,
took up functions in the enterprise, too. My grandfather,
Joseph Turner, managed the sawmill, and also acquired a mill
of his own at Avant, three miles from Rhodes Mill, along the
road to Georgiana. Dan managed the &ldquo;lower mill,&rdquo;
maybe he owned it, a mile and a half downstream from Rhodes
Mill in Persimmon Creek Swamp. He and his twin, Dave,
managed the store or commissary after Uncle Marion and Uncle
Wade went to Greenville.</p>

<div class="figure">

</a>
Store operated by Uncles Dan and Newt in Georgiana, Alabama (1897).
</div>
<p>Later, maybe after the mill
closed, Dan and Newt ran a store in Georgiana. Dan became
mayor and Newt had a cotton brokerage office across the
alley behind the store.</p>

<p>Dave makes colorful copy, but
his life was tragic for his family. He always wanted to
appear more than he was.</p>

<p>Along the road where Grandpa and
his family lived was &ldquo;Uncle Dave&rsquo;s big
house&rdquo; in the fork where the road to the Riley
Cemetery (and in that day, the school house and the Baptist
church). Across the road was &ldquo;Uncle Dave&rsquo;s buggy
house.&rdquo; The house was probably not ostentatious by
subdivision standards, but for the community it was
described as &ldquo;big.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He took over buying for the
commissary, and maybe for the mill, too. Was clerking and
selling too mundane? This took him often to Montgomery, and
it was rumored that he kept a woman there. I am sure the
rumor gave him more pleasure than the woman, if, indeed,
there was one. He speculated in some property or enterprise
on the Isle of Pines, south of Cuba. Some kind of
plantation, maybe. He would go off to visit the property for
weeks at a time.</p>

<p>Dave&rsquo;s wife, Mattie Shell
(another Shell-Rhodes match), was sickly. She may have had
pellagra.</p>

<p>Then, sometime around 1900 or
1902 Dave disappeared. He did not return from one of his
trips. Grandpa hired Burns Detective Agency to try to locate
him, but nothing came of it. Years later someone told my
father that he had died in Arizona, but this was never
confirmed.</p>

<p>Had a speculation gone so badly
that he could not face his ruin in the community? Or had he
been murdered on the road to Georgiana because his sporty
clothes suggested that he carried gold? He would have liked
people to think he did. His body could have been dragged
into the virgin forest and never found. His end may never be
known, but there is no uncertainty that his son, Hubbard,
had to quit school and go to work. Hubbard was my
father&rsquo;s boyhood companion. In the twenties Hubbard
worked in Uncle Dan&rsquo;s store in Georgiana, and later,
after the store closed, at Sims Hardware Store.</p>

<p>Aunt Bessie says Dave&rsquo;s
son was Herbert, and undoubtedly she is correct. That name
is on his tombstone in Georgiana. I leave it Hubbard above
to recall my father&rsquo;s habit of slurring and modifying
some words. When telling of Herbert and when talking to him,
Hubbard is the word that came out.</p>

<p>Aunt Bessie also recalls it was
Pensacola where Dave went to buy. Pensacola seems a likely
place to jump off to the Isle of Pines, and maybe lots of
buying was done there. Certainly timber was sold there. The
mill also had ties to Montgomery; witness the purchase of
tie rods there for the church in what follows, and the
boilers coming from there. Which town does not matter to
this story.</p>

<p>By the eighteen-nineties the
sons were doing the everyday running of the several
enterprises: the sawmill, the grist mill, the commissary,
the cotton gin. Greatgrandfather came to spend more and more
time in his office on the hill above the mill pond. More on
this after a few items about his immediate family.</p><hr>

<p>Sarah Turner Rhodes died in 1883. Greatgrandfather
married a third wife. For years I did not know her name, nor
the date, but I had the impression she was there when my
grandfather was in his teens, in the eighteen-eighties.
Recently David and his family found in the Butler County
Records that she was Matti Amos (possibly her married name,
if she was a widow), age 45, and the date was 1885 when they
married. Also, I think she was from Greenville, a town lady,
if not a city lady. She was sent back to Greenville after a
short time, two, three years, I do not know.
Greatgrandfather&rsquo;s family Bible, which I have, and
other scraps in writing of his are completely silent about
her.</p>

<p>Greatgrandfather was a
circumspect and devout man who never used profanity. Never?
Well, when he was locking this lady&rsquo;s trunk to send
her off he is said to have mashed his hand or finger or
thumb in the trunk lock. With that he exploded: &ldquo;Dad
gummit, Woman, I&rsquo;ve had nothing but trouble since you
came!&rdquo;</p> <hr>

<p>The sons grew up and established their own homesteads.
Grandpa established his on the road above Persimmon Creek
Swamp 0.6 miles from where it dead-ends into the road up gin
hill from the mill. A quarter mile farther south was
Greatgrandfather&rsquo;s log house. Uncle Newt had a
four-room house across the road.</p><hr>

<p>Greatgrandfather needed a housekeeper. Some acquaintance
told him of a lady in Mississippi with three little girls
whose husband had died (killed on the railroad?). Lura
Beasley Young came as his housekeeper sometime in the early
nineties. By all accounts she was a strong, conscientious,
able lady. My grandmother was grateful to her for her
assistance and support as Grandma raised her babies and
small children. Miss Lura would take her children and my
aunts and uncle and my father swimming in the creek beside
the commissary. At some time, Greatgrandfather and Miss Lura
moved into Uncle Newt&rsquo;s house, just across the road
from Grandma and Grandpa. (Uncle Newt must have, by then,
moved to Georgiana.)</p>

<p>The arrangement was going
swimmingly when Uncle Jule&rsquo;s wife began saying through
tight lips how scandalous it was for Papa to have that young
widow in his house! Her daughters Pearl and Olive repeated
their mother&rsquo;s opinions. They were just little girls.
They would have been amusingly ridiculous had they not
spread heartache.</p>

<p>Miss Lura would not tolerate
such. She confronted Greatgrandfather, saying that if people
were going to talk, then she would leave. He then asked her
to marry him. She did in 1895. She was thirty one.
Greatgrandfather was sixty six. Was he railroaded? Did he
get what he wanted, anyway? Should we feel sorry for the old
man? Or should we rejoice for his fortune?</p><hr>

<p>Greatgrandfather moved most of his life in a few square
miles about the mill. The Civil War took him a few hundreds
of miles away, and he must have gone to Greenville many
times. But I see him moving mainly in an area bounded by
Wesley Chapel Church, the mill, and his home.</p>

<p>In his old age, he would mount
his horse, Bill, and ride to his office on the hill above
the mill pond. Someone probably saddled Bill for him. On
cold days a mill hand would bring split blocks of timber to
fire the stove.</p>

<div class="figure">
<a href="http://rhodesmill.org/images/1897-mill:full.jpg">
<img src="http://rhodesmill.org/images/1897-mill:320.jpg">
</a>
The Rhodes Mill in Shell, Alabama (1897).
</div>
<p>When something big enough was
up, he would stroll down to the mill to size up a mechanical
task. In 1897 he strolled down to be photographed, with
Uncle Jule and some six or eight men from the mill, on the
dock where logs were rolled after being drawn up from the
pond. The photographer set up either on the pond bank, and
shot the mill and the men across part of the pond, or else
the floating wharf&mdash;which was usually fast at the
bottom of the log ramp&mdash;was floated out into the pond
for him and his camera. The latter is more likely; the
floating wharf is not to be seen in the photograph.</p>

<p>It was not very cold when the
picture was taken. Some men were in coats, others in
shirtsleeves, but Greatgrandfather has his hat on and a cape
around his shoulders, as befitted an old man.</p>

<p>That could have been the day and
the same photographer who showed him sitting in a chair,
wearing a frock coat, and with a try square in his hands. I
have this picture, too.</p>

<p>Why the try square? Maybe he was
using it when interrupted by the photographer, and maybe it
would remind all who looked that he had a hobby of building
furniture, and had once been a cabinet maker. A table in
Wesley Chapel was shown to me that he had made. Its top was
twenty by thirty inches. It had straight legs, sturdy,
bordering on heavy, serviceable rather than graceful. It had
recently been refinished when I saw it. The yellow pine was
beautiful. Did he build furniture at his office, at home, or
where?</p>

<p>Surely he strolled down from the
office and out to the flood gates the spring day that the
gates were opened, and a huge loggerhead turtle washed in
and jammed, preventing the gates being closed until he was
removed. Father recalled that when teased with a stick, the
turtle would snap a one-by-two in half.</p>

<p>The open gates nearly carried a
boat of fishermen over the dam (or levy), too. One of three
fishermen was Hugh Hall, Sr.&rsquo;s, father. (This was
B.&nbsp;J. Hall, married to Fannie Shell, Uncle Wade&rsquo;s
sister. He died a young man, 27, say. There was much
speculation about his name; he always used initials, only.
Some said it was Bar Jonah, imposing enough. R.&nbsp;Hugh
Hall, Jr. recently found his grandfather&rsquo;s name on his
father&rsquo;s birth certificate. Not imposing at all: Bill
Jones!)</p> <hr>

<p>In his office on the hill Greatgrandfather would also be
available for advice when one of his sons needed it to
manage the mill. Father, as a child, would sometimes go see
him there and come away with a dime. In between relatively
infrequent interruptions he read, <a href="nmr-poems">and he <i>wrote
poetry!</i></a></p>

<p>How did he know there was such a
thing? His schooling must have been minimal, and he had no
library to speak of. His grandchildren remembered his Bible
and a big dictionary, both of which he read often and long.
That is all, besides newspapers and magazines.</p>

<p>On January 12, 1886, just over a
century ago, the mill pond was frozen over. He assembled
some verses that recited several often-expressed sentiments.
First he described the sunlight on the ice, and then he
contemplated the quiet mill, probably closed because of the
weather. The mill was the centerpiece of his worldly
success, which was considerable.</p>

<p>He called on his offspring to
hold the land and keep the mill running. &ldquo;From the
mill the hungry feed&rdquo; in today&rsquo;s idiom would be
maintain the jobs and nourish the community.</p>

<p>It was not a polished poem, but
there may not have been another poem attempted that month in
all the state between Mobile and Montgomery. None of his
other verses are polished, either, but they are as good as
mine. The subjects were homely notions that moved him. He
had the urge to write them down.</p>

<p>On a scrap of paper preserved
with the poem, &ldquo;The Water Mill&rdquo;, he expressed
what all of us with that urge experience. I do not know
whether it was meant to be poetry or prose, but it
contained, &ldquo;when trying [to express] that [which] we
and we alone know&mdash;then we feel at a loss.&rdquo;</p>

<p>His sons did not keep the mill.
The admonition in &ldquo;The Water Mill&rdquo; was a
sentimental whimsy while he sat in the warm office watching
the ice down on the mill pond. In that comfort it may have
seemed that he had built something that would work forever,
forever bringing income and satisfaction to its owners and
its workers.</p>

<p>Each of us would like to think
that his creation will work forever. But we know its life is
limited, whatever it is. Poets know it, and Greatgrandfather
knew it.</p>

<p>He did, in one line, say
&ldquo;improve the mill,&rdquo; but offspring need more
latitude than that. He did not mean hold it at all costs,
once his reverie passed.</p><hr>

<p>Greatgrandfather was lean, almost gaunt, medium height,
with a full beard cut square across his chest. Son, Julius,
was similarly built, and maybe son, Dan. My grandfather,
Joseph Turner, and Uncle Newt tended to be rotund once they
became slightly sedentary.</p><hr>

</a>
Wesley Chapel in Shell, Alabama (1897).
</div>
<p>Greatgrandfather supported the Methodist Church. Wesley
Chapel Church was built with lumber from his mill. The
church is a frame structure, and the builders gave no
thought to thrust from the forty-five degree roof on the
long side walls until the walls began to fail. The solution
was not flying buttresses, as in previous church design
failures. Rather, wrought-iron tie rods, with turnbuckles,
were ordered from Montgomery. They are to be seen in the
church today. My father drove a team and wagon to Georgiana
to get them from the railroad freight or express house.</p><hr>

<p>Greatgrandfather supported the Masonic Order. The
Masonic Lodge was on the hilltop above the mill, the same
hilltop where his office was. The marble slab over his grave
has a large Masonic symbol, the compass, and the big
<i>G</i> carved on it.</p><hr>

<p>His obituary, in the Greenville paper, was a little
flowery, as obituaries were in that day, but it was an
earnest statement by the editor that Greatgrandfather had
been a man of integrity and an asset to the community.</p>

<blockquote>

<p align="center">MR. NEWTON M.
RHODES DEAD</p>

<p align="center">On last Wednesday
afternoon at his home at Shell, this county, Mr. Newton M.
Rhodes passed away. He had been feeble for some days, but
just before his death he seemed better and was up at the
mill. During the day he was taken suddenly ill and the
thread of life gave way. He was about 73 years of age and a
native of this county. For the past thirty years the
deceased has been engaged in the lumber business in the
southern part of the county. Eighteen or twenty years ago he
took several of his sons as partners in the business.</p><hr>

<p>Butler county has never had but few, if any, better men
than the subject of this notice. While he never amassed a
large fortune he was ever in comfortable circumstances, and
never turned a stranger from his door. The writer of this
article has known Mr. Rhodes for more than thirty years and
never knew anything but good of him. He leaves a number of
children among whom are Mrs. W. F. Shell and Mr. Marion
Rhodes of this city. Two are living in Georgiana, one his
youngest, Mrs. A. N. Parker lives in Montgomery, and others
are conducting the business of the Rhodes Mill and
Mercantile Co., at Shell.</p>

<p>The deceased was buried at the
family burial ground near his residence, with the Masonic
service, of which order he had long been a member. He was
also a consistent member of the Methodist church. Rev. Mr.
Sanders, his pastor, officiated with his Masonic brethren at
the funeral. A very large number of relatives and friends
were present.</p>

<p>The Advocate regrets to
chronicle the death of such citizens and extends sympathy to
the many&mdash;</p>
