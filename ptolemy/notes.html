<body><h1>Ptolemy’s cosmos, to scale</h1>
<p>
  Diagrams of Ptolemy’s epicycles and equants
  rarely show their correct relative scale.
  So the “Whole cosmos” and “Inner planets” pages of this site
  show accurate animations of his system,
  with parameters derived from the real-world motion of the planets:

  <li><a href="inner-planets.html">Inner Planets</a>
  <li>Notes «
</ul>
<p>
  Here are some notes about the diagrams:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    They’re built by me,
    <a href="https://rhodesmill.org/brandon/">Brandon Rhodes</a>.

  <li>
    You can find the Python scripts
    that generate the parameters and SVG diagrams
    <a href="https://github.com/skyfielders/astronomy-notebooks/tree/master/Medieval">on GitHub</a>.

  <li>
    The Earth is at each diagram’s center.

  <li>
    The dotted circles are all exactly concentric,
    and are all centered on the Earth.
    They each show the circle that their planet would travel
    if its orbit had zero eccentricity
    and was perfectly centered on the Earth.

  <li>
    But planet orbits are eccentric —
    the circles are not all centered on the Earth.
    So instead of moving along its dotted circle,
    each planet moves along the corresponding solid circle,
    which is called the planet’s <i>deferent</i>.
    The deferent is closest to Earth where it touches the dotted circle
    (the point is marked with a short tick mark)
    and furthest from Earth on the opposite side.

  <li>
    Motion along the deferent is not uniform
    if viewed from the Earth:
    each planet moves faster when close to the Earth
    and slower when far away.
    The motion is only uniform
    when viewed from the planet’s <i>equant,</i>
    an invisible point
    over on the opposite side of the deferent’s center
    from the Earth.
    (Neither the deferents’ centers nor the equants are shown in the diagram,
    as they would create a small crowded forest of dots down around the Earth
    that would be visually difficult to associate with the correct planets.)

  <li>
    The Sun’s motion is simplest.
    It travels directly along its deferent.

  <li>
    The motion of every other planet is complicated by an <i>epicycle:</i>
    a circle whose center travels along the deferent.
    The planet itself revolves around the circumference of the epicycle
    at a simple uniform speed.

  <li>
    Ptolemy used ancient and contemporary observations
    to determine the eccentricity of each equant
    and the size of each planet’s epicycle compared to its deferent.
    The parameters in these diagrams are instead generated
    by taking a modern NASA ephemeris of planetary positions
    and running a SciPy optimizer against them
    to find a best fit for each parameter.

  <li>
    One crucial parameter for each orbit is still undetermined
    even after all the other numbers have been determined:
    how big is the orbit?
    The Greeks could measure no planetary parallax against the fixed stars
    and so lacked any sense of their scale.
    Even if, for example, you doubled the size of Saturn’s deferent,
    you could still make Saturn trace the right path in the sky
    by doubling the size of its epicycle to match.
    So Ptolemy suggested several restrictions
    that together provide a possible scale for the cosmos:

    <ol>
      <li>
        The distance to the Moon’s orbit was known:
        the Greeks estimated it to be 59.7 Earth radii.

      <li>
        Ptolemy chose an order in which to place the planets above the Moon.
        First he listed Mercury and Venus,
        that never stray far from the Sun;
        then the Sun itself;
        and then the outer planets
        from fastest to slowest: Mars, Jupiter, and Saturn.

      <li>
        Next, Ptolemy reasoned that the orbits must be far enough apart
        that the epicycles never collide —
        for example, Saturn’s orbit must be large enough
        to keep its epicycle from ever overlapping with that of Jupiter.

      <li>
        Suspecting that the cosmos would not include
        large yawning gulfs that served no purpose,
        he finished by suggesting that the planet orbits
        would otherwise be stacked as tightly as possible.
    </ol>

    The diagrams here impose exactly these conditions,
    resulting in a maximum height for the outermost planet Saturn
    of 16,551 Earth radii —
    above which must stand the outer edge of the cosmos,
    the sphere of the fixed stars.
    Ptolemy’s own estimate
    was that the cosmos was 20,000 Earth radii across,
    so the parameters computed here
    have permitted a slightly tighter packing than those of Ptolemy.

  <li>
    As you watch the planets move,
    you will notice three coincidences
    which proved momentous for the future of Western science.

    <ol>
      <li>
        <i>Coincidence #1:</i>
        The center of Mercury’s epicycle and Venus’s epicycle
        are always roughly aligned with the Sun.
        If the Earth is the center of planetary motion,
        why aren’t Mercury and Venus free to move independently of the Sun,
        like the outer planets?

      <li>
        <i>Coincidence #2:</i>
        The epicycles of Mars, Jupiter, and Saturn
        all have exactly the same period,
        one solar year.
        Why aren’t their epicycles free to have different periods?

      <li>
        <i>Coincidence #3:</i>
        The epicycles of Mars, Jupiter, and Saturn
        always point in nearly the same direction
        as a line connecting the Earth and Sun.
        If the Earth is the only center of planetary motion,
        why is every outer planet copying the Sun’s motion?

    </ol>

    More than a thousand years later,
    these coincidences drove a Polish scientist named Copernicus
    to famously suggest an alternative to Ptolemy’s system,
    as described in my 2013
    <a href="https://rhodesmill.org/brandon/talks/#copernican-keynote">Keynote
      talk at DjangoCon Europe</a> in Warsaw.

  <li>
    The model illustrated in these diagrams
    is very slightly simpler than Ptolemy’s real model:

    <ol>
      <li>
        The diagram ignores inclination
        and pretends that all the planets orbit in exactly the same plane.
        This seemed reasonable for a two-dimensional diagram
        which would have trouble depicting inclination angles anyway.

      <li>
        The diagram makes the Sun’s deferent
        symmetric with those of the other planets
        by giving it an equant.
        Ptolemy instead deferred
        to the model of his predecessor Hipparchus
        by giving the Sun no equant
        and instead putting the Earth twice as far
        from the center of the Sun’s deferent.

      <li>
        The orbit of Mercury shown here uses only a single epicycle,
        whereas Ptolemy gave it two epicycles
        to better model its motion over the long centuries
        between his own era
        and the observations of the ancient Babylonian astronomers.
    </ol>

  <li>
    I am unlikely to fiddle with this diagram further,
    but if anyone else is interested in tackling
    the second and third inaccuracies listed above,
    I welcome

    where the
    <a href="https://github.com/skyfielders/astronomy-notebooks/tree/master/Medieval"
       >code for this diagram</a>
    lives.

  <li>
    In early drafts of this page
    I kept referring to the model
    as “Ptolemy’s Solar System”
    but it’s not a solar system: the Sun isn’t at its center.
