<P><IMG SRC=images/sixnseven.jpg ALT="" WIDTH=171 HEIGHT=109 ALIGN=RIGHT>Welcome!
These pages describe, catalog, and evaluate the weapons available
in the <A HREF="http://www.rare.co.uk/recent/games/bond/"><NOBR>GoldenEye
007</A></NOBR> video game for the Nintendo.
They attempt to satisfy what has heretofore been a lack of solid analysis
of the game's arms and their relative merits.
<P>
Visitors should first read the section on Damage
that heads off the <A HREF="details.html">Details</A> page,
which defines concepts fundamental to the rest of the site;
they should probably also read the other introductory materials,
then will be able to browse the rest of the site profitably.
A short table of contents is provided at the top of each page
to aid in navigation.
<P>
<B>Update (18 December 2000):</B> two errors in this site
were brought to my attention
by <A HREF="mailto:missilegunboat@yahoo.com">Hu Man Bing</A>,
who contributed to the GoldenEye weapons and ammunition statistics
available at <A HREF="http://www.gamefaqs.com/">www.gamefaqs.com</A>.
Both oversights have been corrected:
the shotgun is recognized as delivering less damage
than the Automatic Shotgun,
and the actual amounts of damage inflicted by Golden weapons -
although very high -
are now correctly stated rather than simply called ``infinite.''
</P>
