<h1>Steam</h1>

<p align="center">Written about
1970. Edited 1982. Slightly revised 1994.</p><hr>

<p>If I was not born a railroad buff, I became one soon
after. Early memories that are warm, that to this day bring
an inner glow upon recall, are mostly railroad memories.</p>

L&N Engine No. 2212 moving through the yards, probably in Birmingham, Alabama.
</div>
<p>One could not see the tracks
nor, usually, the trains from our house for foliage and
other obstructions; but at night the locomotive fire would
shine upwards behind the cab roof and light up the steam and
smoke streaming overhead every time the fire door opened.
For trains outbound east, climbing the three- or four-mile
grade from the valley floor to the cut through Red Mountain
at Irondale, the fire door opened every few seconds, as the
fireman rhythmically shoveled coal. As he came forward with
the scoop of coal his foot operated a treadle that supplied
air to open the fire doors.</p>

<p>From the trackside, just a block
up or down the street, one could see the fireman straddling,
one foot on the cab floor of the engine, the other on the
tender. The timing of his motions and the fire door&rsquo;s
opening were rhythms I had learned well, so I sensed the
swinging of the shovel even when the thing observed was a
flash on the smoke and steam half a mile away.<sup><a href="#note1">1</a></sup></p>

<p>On earlier, smaller locomotives
the fireman could swing open the fire door from time to time
to tend the fire, but the engines grew so big that by the
time of my childhood the fireman was the bottleneck in power
production; the treadle-operated door was absolutely
necessary. Southern&rsquo;s 4700 series of freight
locomotives, and equally big units on the Seaboard, had been
in operation some ten years at that time.</p>

<p>I know not whether it occured in
a very short span of time or over several years, but the
time came when I realized that there was no more rhythmical
illumination of the sky when trains went out at night;
stokers had relieved firemen of the dogged shoveling
required to keep up steam.</p><hr>

<p>Father grew up with a romantic attachment to
railroading, and he did not lose it until his last years
when all interests were past. In 1913 and, later, during the
First World War, he put in some months at the exhausting
task of fireman on Southern&rsquo;s 4500&rsquo;s. In recent
years I learned from Aunt Ethel that during those times he
lost weight, became lean and gaunt. His superlative for
body-breaking manual labor was &ldquo;like firing a
jack.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Engineers he had fired for were
pointed out to me as they brought trains in or took them
out; &ldquo;Hustler&rdquo; O&rsquo;Dell was a remote and
lordly being as he leaned out the cab window to better view
the road ahead, while pulling his whistle strap with his
left hand; he was all concentration on the job of getting
his train over the road. Only seldom would he be diverted
sufficiently to raise his gloved right hand in an attenuated
wave.</p>

</div>
<p>Father&rsquo;s romantic view was
not uncommon for boys of his time, and it was reinforced by
such delicious pleasures as being carried to Montgomery from
Georgiana on the engine by Cousin Jeff Hudson.<sup><a href="#note2">2</a></sup>
Father&rsquo;s joy must have equaled that expressed by
Walter Chrysler over riding the engine with his father:
&ldquo;At the end of the day a boy&rsquo;s face would be
sore from constant and incessant grinning.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Father&rsquo;s love affair with
railroads was early communicated to me through his
reminiscences, and this was reinforced by the proximity of
the tracks&mdash;Seaboard, one long block to the south; one
block north, two double tracks of AGS, to Chattanooga, and
Southern, to Atlanta. The last also carried Central of
Georgia trains to Leeds, where they took their own track to
Columbus, Georgia. Father&rsquo;s watch has a dent in the
back, put there by the shaker bar of&nbsp;4563. Fire grates
were in four sections. A fireman could not shake all the
grates at once. A three or four foot steel bar would be
fitted over each of four stub levers in succession. Each
stub was linked to its section of the grates under the fire.
He had heaved the bar against the breast pocket of his
overalls, the pocket containing his watch.</p>

<p>There were stories of adventure
out on the road and in the yards. &ldquo;You would have to
read every one of those lights to bring a train in
here,&rdquo; he would say to me, a small child, as we drove
across the end of the AGS or Seaboard marshalling yards at
night, and the hundreds of colored switch lights made a
Christmas tree of the yard. There was a locomotive that one
night quietly backed out of the Finley round house,
unmanned, and was rolling for the cinder pits down the hill,
where men were working. Father, on his way to work, boarded
it, climbed into the dark cab, and took it back to a round
house. The foreman had not missed it!<sup><a href="#note3">3</a></sup></p>

<p>No Negro was promoted to
engineer in those days, but there were a fair number of
Colored firemen, and they were good ones, Father judged.
They were bred to hard labor, and they had a knack for
keeping a hot fire. But they liked to make lots of black
smoke, Father said. And out on the road they would work like
fury, shovelling coal, shaking grates, putting water into
the boiler. This to be ready, when they rolled through a
town, to jump up onto the box beside the window, and lean
way out on the left elbow, intent on the road ahead. I think
I would have done so too. It was not just the Colored
firemen.</p>

<p>Maybe several stories got
compounded into one epic run to Atlanta from Birmingham with
eighty cars of mules. World War&nbsp;I was going on; a ship
was ready to sail from Savannah as soon as this trainload of
mules, which had come in from the west, was loaded. The
dispatcher gave them the road; orders were to make only
necessary stops for water and coal.</p>

<p>But people on epic journeys are
always tried with difficulties. As the last tipple-car of
coal hit the tender, a chain snapped, and a ton of coal was
dumped into the gangway. Several chains would be strung
across the front of the tender to hold the coal when the
tender was full; they would be taken down when enough coal
had been used so that the rest stayed in the tender by
itself.</p>

<p>No time to fix that; Hustler
O&rsquo;Dell had gone over his engine, and was growling that
he wanted the gauge to read 210 pounds all night long.
(Because of the urgency of the run, Father and O&rsquo;Dell
must have been on the engine before the hostlers were
through preparing it.)</p>

<p>They coupled up, tried the
brakes, and moved out of the yard through the dusk.
O&rsquo;Dell could keep his drivers torqued within a hair of
slipping, and never loose hold. They moved out fast, then up
the long grade to the cut through the mountain. Father
fought furiously to keep up steam, and between each
shovel-full into the firebox, he would throw another off
onto the trackside. &ldquo;I knew that if there were coal in
the gangway when he turned down the mountain, I would be
unable to stand up.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He got the coal out from
underfoot, but he still could not stand up when they
rocketed down grade, up to eighty miles per hour he judged.
He hung onto grab-irons, and tried to tend water and do
other tasks that it was possible to do with one hand. Maybe
there were not many miles like this, but those miles were
memorable. The route is a crooked one: one hundred and
sixty-nine miles, one hundred and sixty-nine curves.</p>

<p>Water taken in haste; coal taken
impatiently at Anniston and at Waco, where the fire was
cleaned of clinkers by Colored laborers. No turning into
sidetracks; all traffic in both directions sidetracked for
Father, for O&rsquo;Dell, for eighty cars of mules.</p>

<p>They steamed into Inman Yard in
just five hours, passenger train time in those days. Another
crew and engine must have gotten the train to Savannah (on
another railroad), and the mules must have gotten to
France.</p> <hr>

Small steam engine used between Glasgow, Kentucky, and Mammoth Cave
</div>
<p>Not just stories; there was the glory of the thing
itself. A fast passenger train braking to a stop, downhill
at Woodlawn in the winter dusk: ten cars, sixty car wheels,
on my side of the train, rimmed with fire. The immensity of
a steam locomotive, and the massive tasks it accomplished,
were awesome, and all the machinery was out where you could
see it. An accident led to my being able to observe the
machinery at low speed for several years, as will be
recounted below. A nail on the track would be flattened, and
knocked off by the pony trucks of the locomotive, but the
nail would still be hot after the train had passed, if it
was a fast passenger train. The open, nearly flat area where
the railroad parallels Fifth Avenue south between 56th and
57th Streets was a good place to do such impressive
blacksmithing.<sup><a href="#note4">4</a></sup></p>

<p>There was, besides romance,
anxiety and the constant near presence of death, for the
crew and for the unwary who tangled with a train. When I was
a small child, I vividly recall Cousin Ellen, Jeff&rsquo;s
widow, telling of the terrible moan in the night of the
wrecker whistle, calling its crew, while her Jeff was
somewhere out on the road. She had owned a big house in
Montgomery near the railroad yards, and she may have boarded
railroad men.<sup><a href="#note2">2</a></sup></p>

<p>Neighbor, Clarence Allgood, lost
a leg when he tried to board a moving freight train right
down the street. Our maid, Ella, had worked for the
Allgoods, and lived in their servant house, at the time. It
was close to home, although I never knew Clarence, who
became a well known Birmingham attorney.</p>

<p>The aunt of schoolmate, later
scout-mate, Ted Bumann was walking one summer morning north
on 56th&nbsp;Street, dressed to catch the street car and go
to town. She crossed the Southern tracks, and as she
traversed the hundred feet to the AGS tracks, she speeded up
to a fast walk or half run, apparently to get across the AGS
tracks ahead of a passenger train from Chattanooga. She
misjudged. In the middle of the track she threw up her hands
in horror. My mother saw the body tumble beside the train
120 feet past the crossing. Mother had been waiting in her
car for the train to pass. I heard the story many times,
including the time it was told to a railroad agent who
investigated the accident.</p>

<p>A bad accident involving a train
and a street car at a flagged crossing had many
consequences. It occurred three short blocks from home at
Grand Avenue (now First Avenue South). For days the
neighborhood ladies told and retold of the terrible
mutilation. It was generally thought that the accident
spelled the end of the &ldquo;Tidewater&rdquo; street
railway line. (A projected interurban: Birmingham, Tidewater
&amp; Coast. It ran from East Lake to Bessemer, and had
ambitions to go on to Tuscaloosa and beyond.) They soon sold
out to their competitor, BR&amp;P Co., who did some
rerouting. Their hardy cars carried me to college on the
South East Lake line twelve to sixteen years later.</p>

<p>Another consequence of the
accident was that by ordinance or agreement, trains and
street cars thereafter stopped at all grade crossings where
the two met. Rerouting of street cars took care of the
crossing where the accident had occurred, but for several
years, until an overpass was built, Seaboard trains stopped
at Grand Avenue (now Fifth Avenue South) about
52nd&nbsp;Street. Outbound trains were on the long grade
that took them over Red Mountain, and heavy freights had a
difficult time getting underway after the stop; they never
picked up much speed until they crossed the ridge three
miles beyond.</p>

<p>A regular freight stopped at the
crossing about 6:15 AM. It would only be travelling at
walking speed half a mile after getting under way and
leaving the crossing. Sometimes for a block, sometimes for a
mile, I would walk beside the driving wheels, admiring the
valve linkage, the oily brass piston and valve rods, and the
forged steel I-beam that was the driving rod. To earn a
hiking merit badge I had to log five miles of walking a day
for several months. During this interval I was often out
before breakfast to roam the mountainside woods, and I would
wait for this train at the head of 55th Place. The reverse
lever must have been hard forward, as every exhaust was an
explosion.</p>

<p>Another seaboard freight fought
its way up that hill every evening about&nbsp;8:20. Lots of
men were riding freights during the Depression, and nearly
every night two detectives would scan the slowly moving
train with flashlights. They would station themselves on the
banks on both sides of the track at 55th Street. If a rider
were discovered, they would board the train and take him
off; or he would jump off and run, and they would persue
him. They caught one in Mr.&nbsp;Batcheller&rsquo;s corn
patch at 56th Street once. I do not know whether they were
free-lance deputies, who got a fee for each arrest, or
whether they were railroad employees discouraging hoboes
because cars had been broken into, or coal thrown off loaded
cars. To me, this was just an act to watch, the most
interesting thing being the boarding and dismounting of the
moving train. (Clarence Allgood&rsquo;s story must have
gotten to me; I never had the slightest urge to board one.)
But Father knew the brutal reputation of railroad
detectives; and, whenever &rsquo;bos would stop at our door
for a handout (and there were many), he would warn them
where the dicks were likely to be.<sup><a href="#note5">5</a></sup></p>

<p>During the early thirties an
occasional exhibition train pulled by a Diesel locomotive
would come through, usually pulling three shiny light
passenger cars. Father would pooh-pooh the preposterous
notion that one of those &ldquo;street cars&rdquo; would
ever pull a freight train. &ldquo;Why, I&rsquo;ve seen a
Mack truck nearly tear itself up moving one freight car
around the lumber yard.&rdquo; An internal combustion engine
would never do what steam could do. &ldquo;Imagine what the
clutch would have to be.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then one day&mdash;about
1945&mdash;I saw steam die.<sup><a href="#note6">6</a></sup> These were war years, and
steam locomotives would haul trains millions of miles more,
but steam was doomed, I knew. Father and I were in an auto
stopped at the grade crossing at 56th Street. An outbound
southern freight was stopped with its Diesel engines across
our road. Freight cars trailed down the grade behind the
locomotives; the end was out of sight around a long curve
that started half a mile away. Ready to go: the board just
ahead changed; the engines revved up; a sense of tautness
appeared in the trucks, and in three or four seconds the
locomotives began to creep forward up the mountain.
Father&rsquo;s mouth dropped open as he watched that string
of cars. There was no slack in the train! And it started off
up the grade! To start under such circumstances, he was used
to backing the engine down to move each drawhead as far as
it would go into each car frame member. Draft is transferred
from the couple to the carframe through two forged
horizontal protrusions on the drawhead; they pass through
reinforced holes in a box girder of the car frame. (Fancier,
hydraulic-cushioned couples are available now.)
&ldquo;Slack&rdquo; came from play of the protrusions in the
holes, and play in the couple itself. After backing down,
the engine would start up with no load, and every time it
moved forward an inch, say, it would snatch one more car
forward. With a dramatic &ldquo;h-r-r-r&mdash;umph,&rdquo;
the wave would rocket back the train. This long train
started upgrade with no slack. Father stared while several
freight cars moved past in front of us, then he weakly
whispered, &ldquo;He&rsquo;s pulling the whole yard out
behind him.&rdquo;</p><hr>

<p>About 1946 a man close to the Association of American
Railroads told me there was not a single order outstanding
for a steam locomotive to be delivered in this country. I
knew it was coming, but this was faster than I had expected.
(Baldwin Locomotive Works did not expect the change so soon,
either. They went under soon after, apparently because they
stuck to steam too long. It is sad to see a company over a
hundred years old go down.)</p>

<p>It has been sad, too, to see the
opportunities that railroad management has missed over the
years. Since before 1900 railroads have preferred the
freight business, and their innovation and the development
of rolling stock, signaling, and data handling have been
spectacular. Billions were invested in locomotives, freight
yards and other capital items in the years following World
War&nbsp;II.</p>

<p>Father, as a boy, paddled a boat
for colorful and irascible L&amp;N president Milton Smith,
when he would come to fish in the millpond at Rhodes&rsquo;
Mill. Smith said then that he would as soon never run
another passenger train.</p>

<p>There was enough public feeling
of romance about railroading to have created the foundation
of public support that any far-flung enterprise has to have.
But railroads, in their ephemeral might, did not know it was
necessary, and scorned passengers, their best opportunity
for constructive contact with the public. Freight customers
do not constitute the public.</p>

<p>No innovations made it easy to
buy a ticket. Seldom was it evident that a train crew gave a
hoot about maintaining a schedule, and too, too often,
trainmen were adverse to common courtesy to their
passengers, their customers.</p>

<p>The latent public support,
waiting and wanting to be ignited, was evident on an L&amp;N
train, hours late, southbound to Birmingham during World
War&nbsp;II. Passengers got the notion that the trainmen
were intent on making up all the lost time they possibly
could. (It is more likely that a manifest freight was on
their heels.) The engineer had a clear road to practice that
intent. Passengers were thrown from the aisle when they
tried to go to the water fountain or the rest room. Were
they angered by this? They were not. When a large man landed
in a lady&rsquo;s lap, both laughed, and he climbed up to
try again. At the end of that run those passengers would
have cheered in a mighty voice for the L&amp;N Railroad. A
little sincere care for the traveling public and the nation
would have cheered, too. But such care was carefully
withheld.</p>

<p>What might-have-been could be
glimpsed in the B&amp;O operation in the north end of
Baltimore, even during wartime. You could sit in summer
clothes on padded wicker benches on the concourse of their
Mount Royal Station and cleanly board your train or meet
incoming passengers. All freight north, as well as passenger
trains, traversed that roofed concourse. Coal-burning steam
locomotives powered their trains, but they were pulled
through the tunnels of the city and this concourse by
electric locomotives; their coal fires would be banked. Two
blocks away was the Pennsylvania Station. There, trains were
hauled by those wonderful electric GG1&rsquo;s, inherently
clean locomotives. But one felt unclean after walking
through their station.<sup><a href="#note7">7</a></sup></p>

<p>Jim Hard got to the core of the
problem by recognizing that passenger and freight were two
entirely different businesses, retail and wholesale,
respectively. Both used tracks and locomotives, but the two
businesses needed separate personnel and management. A
middle aged conductor &ldquo;promoted&rdquo; to passenger
service, after years in a caboose, was unlikely to be able
to satisfactorily meet the public.<sup><a href="#note8">8</a></sup></p>

<p>Some years ago, since World
War&nbsp;II, a monument was dedicated at the burial place in
Tennessee of &ldquo;Casey&rdquo; (John Luther) Jones. Mrs.
Jones was there; their son, a GM&amp;O engineer was there;
Sim Webb, Casey&rsquo;s Colored fireman on 382, was there.
The president of the IC refused to participate because Casey
had wrecked their locomotive; how little understanding can a
man have?<sup><a href="#note9">9</a></sup></p>

<h2>Notes</h2><ol>

<li><p><a name="note1">I</a> shovelled left-handed.
Father would comment on it whenever he saw me with a shovel,
implying, it seemed, I would never be a fireman.</p>

<li><p><a name="note2">Cousin</a> Jeff Hudson was my
Grandfather Rhodes&rsquo; cousin, son of a sister of
Greatgrandfather, Newton M. Rhodes. The Hudson homestead was
a two-storey frame house set up off the ground on wooden
pillars, some four feet long, that were barked logs. Wind
under the house had blown the dirt away until each pillar
stood on a pedestal of dirt two or three inches high when
Father was a child. The house was on the ridge just east of
Persimmon Creek where much of the Rhodes clan lived.</p>

<p>When Jeff&rsquo;s father died,
Greatgrandfather took informal responsibility for raising
him.</p>


<p>Cousin Ellen, Jeff&rsquo;s wife,
was a Cook from the same neighborhood, but no blood kin.
When I knew her she was dumpy, jolly, had earrings through
her pierced ears. She still owned the big house in
Montgomery, but she was married to Mr. Neal, and lived in
Capital Heights. Her son, Jeff, operates Hudson Office
Supply in Dothan. Before World War&nbsp;II, after he
finished his education, Jeff Jr. was with Burroughs in
Birmingham. I saw him once or twice soon after he went
there. Cousin Ellen&rsquo;s daughter, Mary Ellen, married
and continued to live in Montgomery.</p>

<li><p><a name="note3">No</a> air was up for brakes, but
steam was up, and with it Father stopped the locomotive, and
drove it forward.</p>

<li><p><a name="note4">Nails</a> crossed on the track
would be welded together, too.</p>

<li><p><a name="note5">Father</a> was tight-lipped when
Mother rented one of her houses to a railroad detective, a
big beefy Irish looking fellow. But renters with jobs were
scarce during the Depression. His wife, also an Irish type,
would get unreasonably riled up if we called her to say
water was low in the ARCOLA heating system, as evidenced by
steam coming out of its vent.</p>

<p>My sister told Father of a child
in her Sunday School class, son of a near-neighbor who had
been a railroad detective, getting hysterical about a Negro
killing his daddy. Father&rsquo;s response was,
&ldquo;Mr.&nbsp;&mdash; was a mean man.&rdquo;</p>

<li><p><a name="note6">When</a> this was first written I
dated steam&rsquo;s death about 1940. 1940 is about the time
they were moving all the dirt to install the overpasses on
55th Street and between Fifth Avenue and First Avenue South.
There were no Diesel freight trains then. Southern&rsquo;s
6300 may have been the first, and these went into service
during World War&nbsp;II, hence my current choice of date,
1945.</p>

<li><p><a name="note7">Those</a> B&amp;O G.E. electric
locomotives, only two of them, had been in service 50 years
when I knew them. An item in <i>Scientific
American&rsquo;s</i> column, &ldquo;Fifty Years Ago,&rdquo;
about 1944 described them.</p>

<p>A photo of the clean concourse
at Mount Royal and one of the electric locomotives, circa
1910&ndash;1920, is in Jensen, pp 204&ndash;5, Note 7,
below. This little clean patch in the railroad industry
possibly endured for over fifty years.</p>

<li><p><a name="note8">Jim</a> Hard put forth this notion
about separate businesses in a conversation about 1960.
Since then I found the theme stated by Peter Lyon,
<i>American Heritage</i>, Feb.&nbsp;1968, p.&nbsp;84, in an
excerpt from his book, <i>To Hell in a Day Coach</i>
(Lippincott, 1967), and in a later article by Lyon in
<i>American Heritage</i>. Oliver Jenson in <i>American
Heritage History of Railroads in America</i> says
(p.&nbsp;194) the conductor &ldquo;was an awesome figure
and, more often than not, a frightful grouch&mdash;an
understandable holdover from his early days as
brakeman.&rdquo;</p>

<li><p><a name="note9">Janie</a> Jones died in November,
1958, 58&frac12; years after April 30, 1900. The ceremony
was before her death and after 1946, the end of World
War&nbsp;II.</p>
