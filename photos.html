<b>Rhodes Mill and its founder Newton Marion
Rhodes&nbsp;(1897).</b> The Greatgrandfather essay <a href=
"jer-greatgrandfather.html#1897-mill">describes</a> this image:
&ldquo;he strolled down to be photographed, with Uncle Jule and
some six or eight men from the mill, on the dock where logs were
rolled after being drawn up from the pond. ... It was not very cold
when the picture was taken. Some men were in coats, others in
shirtsleeves, but Greatgrandfather has his hat on and a cape around
his shoulders, as befitted an old man.&rdquo;<br></td>
